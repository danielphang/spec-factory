## Context for this run (composed by the harness, not part of the request)

Repository: `spec-factory`, the design repo at `~/dev/spec-factory` (branch `main`). It holds the
design and the harness that runs it:
- `docs/design.md`, the design document and the source of truth, with its changelog in
  `docs/changelog.md`;
- `docs/prompts/`, each file a verbatim copy of one prompt block in the design doc; it changes only
  by re-copying that block;
- `dev/`, the working documents for building the factory itself: `dev/build-harness.spec.md` (the
  spec for building the harness), `dev/build-harness.plan.md` (the Planner's decomposition of it),
  `dev/P0-intake-skeleton.md` (the walking skeleton) and `dev/issues.md` (this repo's issue index);
- the harness, as code in this repo: `factory/` (the package, its role prompts and its workflow
  scripts), `bin/factory` (the entry point), `agents/` (the agent definition templates) and
  `tests/factory/` (its suite). Install with `uv sync --frozen`; test with
  `uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory`;
- `.factory/`, this repo's own instance of the factory: `instance.yaml`, this briefing,
  `harness.lock`, closed records (`answers/`, `green-pilot/`) and the live store, `store/`.
  The store is a checkout of its own branch, `factory-store`; the operator commits it there, so a
  store commit never moves `main`.

Two checkouts. Tickets are built and merged in the dev checkout, `~/dev/spec-factory` on `main`.
The factory runs from the runtime checkout, `~/dev/spec-factory-harness`, a detached worktree of
this repo at the harness revision `.factory/harness.lock` has accepted. A merge into `main` never
changes the running code; only the upgrade step moves the runtime, after which the instance
refuses its store until `--accept-harness`. Your shell may start in another directory: use
absolute paths, or `cd ~/dev/spec-factory && <cmd>`.

The Nanobot fork at `~/dev/nanobot-upstream` (branch `feat/lionbot-v3.5`) is instance A: a target
with only `.factory/`, run from the same runtime by its own Driver session. This repo's harness was
imported from its retired `feat/lionbot-v3` branch. Read it only to observe what a fix does there; never write there, and never copy its test names,
line numbers or commit SHAs into a spec. Never read or write `~/.nanobot/` (live credentials).

Acceptance commands must be runnable as written from `~/dev/spec-factory` (grep, sed, diff,
`git diff --check` against the documents, the harness suite). A change to the design doc keeps its
own conventions: its changelog entry in `docs/changelog.md`, `dev/build-harness.spec.md`
consistent with the new text, and any `docs/prompts/` file whose block changed re-copied from it.

The request is an issue draft, written from a real pipeline run: where in the documents,
what happened (the evidence), why it matters, a proposed fix, and the Nanobot-side commit
where a harness fix already exists. The evidence is the requirement; the proposed fix is the
requester's suggestion, not a requirement. Verify the as-built fix in the reference harness
before relying on it; a NEW criterion that already passes on this checkout proves nothing.

Output: write your complete output, in your role's required format and ending with the
STATUS / CONFIDENCE / ESCALATIONS trailer, to the file named under "Output file" below. For
every role but the implementer that is the only file you may create or modify. The implementer
also changes files in its own worktree and commits there, and nowhere else. Then return the same
text as your final message.

This repo's current-state page is the top-level `README.md`. A change to a command, state, stop or
path updates it in the same ticket; read its "Maintaining this page" section before editing it.

Who reads what the roles write here: the operator at the spec gate, and a technical reader new to this project reading the README or a PR description. Gloss every term specific to the factory at first use (docs/writing.md).
## Output file
`/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/runs/run-0330-critic/output.md`

## Running code
Run every test, script or prototype through this wrapper, which gives it a fresh temporary HOME so it cannot write the operator's real home directory: `(export HOME="$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P)"; <command>)`. Put your command in place of <command>. This includes every test or check command the briefing above gives. A throwaway HOME does not stop a write to an absolute path: never run anything that could write a protected path outside the repository.

## Scratch directory
Put every file you make for your own use in this run under `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/runs/run-0330-critic/scratch`: no other run uses it. The harness clears it when the ticket moves on, and keeps it while the ticket is parked.

## Spec under review (v1)

=== proposal.md
## Problem

The factory runs each ticket through a chain of AI agents, each with its own prompt (its "role"). Two of them shape a spec before a human approves it: the **spec writer**, which turns an accepted ticket into a spec, and the **critic**, which reviews that spec against a rubric and either approves it, sends it back once, or escalates to the human.

Issue #73 (merged as `05cf8f9`) gave both roles rules meant to save tokens. The critic got four: a per-claim cap (settle any one claim with at most two file paths and one command), a no-build rule (no clone, worktree or prototype of the change), a no-test-suite rule, and three reading rules (batch independent reads, read only the line range grep found, send long output to a file). On 2026-10-08 the operator replayed three past intakes with the old and new prompts. The writer's rules cut its tokens by about 37% at the same quality, and the operator accepted them. The critic's rules saved no tokens. They also made it check less, and it missed a real defect on two of the three tickets. One of those defects the old prompt had confirmed with a small experiment in a throwaway git repository, which the no-build rule now forbids.

So the critic as it stands on `main` is a worse reviewer at no saving. The operator decided to take out the per-claim cap and the no-build rule, keep the no-test-suite rule and the reading rules, and leave the writer's rules alone. The runtime, the pinned copy of the harness that actually runs tickets, has not yet picked up #73. It is meant to pick up #73's writer rules and this revert together, so that no live critic runs under the rules the operator rejected.

## Evidence

- Operator's acceptance record, `.factory/answers/T-0034-acceptance-2026-10-08.md`: "Critic: no token change (0.71→0.72M, 1.0→0.93M, 1.67→1.63M); verified less and missed real findings on two of three. Not accepted." and "Operator's choice: "Writer only: revert critic part first"."
- The request's replay table: on #51 the critic missed the Nanobot `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR` risk the original prompt found; on #57 it missed the brace-list declaration bug the original confirmed with a scratch git test. The replay files themselves (`eval73/` in another session's scratch directory) were not read for this spec.
- The rules sit in three copies of the critic prompt, identical in this section. `git grep -n 'Ground any one claim'` on `main` (`49ea4c7`) prints `docs/design.md:469`, `docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md:43` and `factory/prompts/critic.md:43`. The PROCESS section there reads:
  ```
  Spot-check at least 2 cited paths and 1 acceptance command yourself.
  Ground any one claim with at most 2 paths and 1 command. Run no test
  suite and build nothing: no clone, worktree or prototype of the change.
  Pick an acceptance command that runs no test suite, and run it as the
  spec gives it. A claim you could settle only by running a test suite or
  building the change is a finding for the writer, or a question; say
  what you could not check.
  ```
  `git show f25dffe` shows that the #73 commit added these lines (all but the first) and the Turn economy paragraph after them.
- `docs/principles.md:44-45` (principle 2) lists among its mechanisms "the critic's PROCESS section, which runs no test suite and builds nothing (#73, `factory/prompts/critic.md`)". `docs/principles.md:169-178` (the Spiking section, from #72, `2e73dbb`) says the critic's grounding is bounded to "two paths, one command" and ends "it does not build". Spiking is the last section of the file (178 lines).
- `git grep` for `at most 2 paths`, `build nothing`, `builds nothing`, `does not build`, `two paths, one command` and `no clone, worktree` finds no hit in `README.md`, `dev/` or `tests/factory/`. So no README text, build-spec text or existing test pins these rules.
- Current truth for `harness-docs` pins the old rule in three requirements: "The spec writer and the critic carry the turn-economy rules" (its scenario expects the cap and no-build phrases, `critic ... doc=6/6`), "Spec writer and critic runs receive the turn-economy rules" (expects `suite=1 cap=1` on the phrase `Run no test suite and build nothing`), and "The documents record the turn-economy change" (expects principle 2 to say `runs no test suite and builds nothing (#73, ...)`). "Nothing else in the two prompts changes" says the change MUST NOT remove a line of the critic prompt. This change removes lines, so all four are restated below.
- I prototyped the change in a scratch clone (`scratch/proto`, the edit script `scratch/edit.py`) and ran every scenario below on both the base checkout and the prototype, each under a throwaway HOME. Base output is quoted under verification.md; on the prototype every scenario printed its THEN line exactly. On the prototype, `tests/factory/test_writing_standard.py` and `tests/factory/test_coding_standard.py`, which check that each design block equals its `docs/prompts/` copy, printed `10 passed`.

## Root cause

The critic's PROCESS section in `docs/design.md` (the "## 3. Spec critic" block, lines 467-474), `docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md:42-47` and `factory/prompts/critic.md:42-47` carries the per-claim cap and the no-build sentence #73 added. `docs/principles.md` principle 2 (line 44-45) and the Spiking section (lines 171-178) describe those rules as the critic's design. Per the replay, the critic's cost is mostly its fixed start-up context, so capping its checks did not lower its cost; it lowered what it found.

## Out of scope

- The spec writer prompt, in all three copies: it stays exactly as #73 left it.
- The critic's rubric, round limit, output format, its minimum spot-check (2 cited paths, 1 acceptance command), its no-test-suite rule, its acceptance-command rule and its three reading rules.
- Any other prompt, `agents/`, the shared preamble, `README.md` (it names none of the removed rules) and `dev/build-harness.spec.md` (likewise).
- `dev/issues.md`'s index row for #74: the operator's own `dev:` commits maintain it.
- Moving the runtime to the merged revision: an operator step after merge, not this change.
- Re-running the replay: an operator step, not acceptance.

## Open questions

none

## Decisions

- This change overturns part of the 2026-10-08 T-0034 standing decision, "The critic runs no test suite and builds nothing ... Standing: a later change to the critic prompt keeps this rule". The no-test-suite half stands. The no-build half and the per-claim cap (the other 2026-10-08 T-0034 line) are removed. Authority: the operator's choice in `.factory/answers/T-0034-acceptance-2026-10-08.md`. Standing: later changes to the critic prompt keep the no-suite rule and do not re-add a per-claim cap or a no-build rule without new evidence.
- The critic prompt gains one sentence that allows a small experiment in its scratch directory to confirm a finding. Without it, the kept sentence "A claim you could settle only by ... building the change is a finding" reads as the old ban. The kept sentence still covers building or trying out the change itself, which item C leaves to the writer or a spike. Rejected: deleting the kept sentence. The triage asked to keep it, and it still tells the critic what to do with a claim it cannot check.
- The no-suite line gains its reason, "the implementer and the verifier run it", as the request's item B gives. `Pick an acceptance command that runs no test suite, and run it as the spec gives it.` and the Turn economy paragraph stay word for word.
- The Spiking section records the replay result, item C's "Record the replay result". The changelog entry records it too.
- Of the current-truth requirements that #73 added, four are restated (MODIFIED), because each states the rule being removed or forbids removing a critic line. Other current-truth requirements that check the diff of their own change (for example "The documents record the live-store guard", which expects no prompt copy to change) are left as they are, as #73 left them. Their scenarios describe their own change, not standing behaviour.
- "Writer unchanged from #73" is checked as no difference from `05cf8f9` in either writer prompt file, plus the writer's design block equal to its `docs/prompts/` copy. Together these mean the design block is unchanged too.

## Risk

- Blast radius: every critic run after the operator moves the runtime. The critic may spend more turns per review, for example on a scratch experiment. The replay shows the version with no cap and no build ban at about the same token cost. No routing, store, CLI or workflow code changes.
- Protected paths this change touches:
  - `factory/prompts/critic.md` (harness)
  - `docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md` (generated; re-copied from the design doc block, never edited apart from it)
- Not protected, also changed: `docs/design.md`, `docs/principles.md`, `docs/changelog.md`.

## Operator steps

1. After merge, move the runtime to a revision that holds both `05cf8f9` (#73) and this change, and accept it with `--accept-harness`, as the request's "Then" line says.
2. Optional: re-run the critic replay on #51 and #57 with the merged critic prompt, to confirm it finds the `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR` risk and the brace-list declaration bug again. The result belongs in the acceptance record, not in this ticket's checks.
3. Update `dev/issues.md`'s #74 row once merged.

=== design.md
## Proposed change

**A. Critic PROCESS, in all three copies.** In the "## 3. Spec critic" block of `docs/design.md`, then `docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md` (re-copied from that block), then `factory/prompts/critic.md`, replace the seven lines from `Spot-check at least 2 cited paths ...` through `what you could not check.` with:

```
Spot-check at least 2 cited paths and 1 acceptance command yourself.
Run no test suite: the implementer and the verifier run it. Pick an
acceptance command that runs no test suite, and run it as the spec
gives it. To confirm a finding you may run a small experiment in your
scratch directory, such as a few git commands in a throwaway
repository. A claim you could settle only by running a test suite or
building the change is a finding for the writer, or a question; say
what you could not check.
```

The `Turn economy:` paragraph that follows stays byte for byte. Nothing else in the critic prompt changes. The run copy's one existing difference from the documented copy (`round 2` against `round {2}`) stays.

**B. `docs/principles.md`, principle 2.** Change "the critic's PROCESS section, which runs no test suite and builds nothing (#73, `factory/prompts/critic.md`)." to "the critic's PROCESS section, which runs no test suite (#73, kept by #74, `factory/prompts/critic.md`)." The status line ("done by #41 for the code reviewer and by #73 for the critic ...") stays.

**C. `docs/principles.md`, Spiking section.** Replace its paragraph with:

```
Grounding a claim the spec makes, for example that a path exists or that an acceptance command fails
on the base, is the critic's job. Its prompt sets a floor, two cited paths and one acceptance command,
and no ceiling. To confirm a finding, the critic may run a small scratch check, such as a few git
commands in a throwaway repository; it runs no test suite (principle 2). Vetting whether a whole
approach works is implementation. A critic that builds the change duplicates work the implementer
redoes, in a disposable checkout, and the result survives only as a sentence in a finding. Principle 1
is the reason: a critic's trial of an approach is self-repair's weak signal, and an implementer's is
execution feedback. So vetting a whole approach belongs to the spec writer during investigation, with
its output in Evidence, or to a spike ticket on #64's spike path, run by an implementer and recorded
as a decision. #73 capped the critic at two paths and one command for any one claim and forbade any
build. #74's replay of three past intakes (#49, #51, #57), with the same inputs, found that the critic
then used about the same tokens (0.71M to 0.72M, 1.0M to 0.93M, 1.67M to 1.63M), checked less, and
missed a real finding on two of the three, one of which the earlier prompt had confirmed with a
scratch git test. #74 removed the cap and the no-build rule and kept the no-suite rule.
```

**D. `docs/changelog.md`.** Append entry 59 as the last numbered entry, one line:

```
59. After issue #74 (2026-10-08), where the operator's replay of three past intakes (#49, #51, #57), with the same inputs and bases, found that #73's spec writer rules cut its tokens by about 37% at the same quality, but that its critic rules saved nothing (0.71M to 0.72M, 1.0M to 0.93M, 1.67M to 1.63M tokens) and made the critic check less: it missed the Nanobot `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR` risk on #51 and, on #57, the brace-list declaration bug that the earlier prompt had confirmed with a scratch git test. The critic's PROCESS drops the per-claim cap (at most two paths and one command for any one claim) and the no-build rule (no clone, worktree or prototype), and says the critic may run a small experiment in its scratch directory to confirm a finding. It keeps its minimum spot-check, the rule that it runs no test suite, the rule for picking an acceptance command, the rule that a claim needing a suite run or a build of the change is a finding or a question, and the three reading rules. `docs/principles.md` principle 2 keeps the critic's no-suite rule, and its Spiking section drops the two-path bound and says that vetting a whole approach is still the spec writer's or a spike's job. The spec writer prompt is unchanged from #73.
```

Size: about 30 added and 20 removed lines across five files (prototype `git diff --stat main...HEAD`).

## Tests to change

none. No test under `tests/factory/` names the removed phrases (`git grep`, Evidence). The two tests that compare design blocks with their `docs/prompts/` copies pass on the prototype (`10 passed`), because the three copies change together.

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The spec writer and the critic carry the turn-economy rules
Every copy of the spec writer prompt SHALL tell it to batch independent reads and commands, read line ranges once grep has found them, keep long output in a scratch file, and write the spec in as few writes as it can. Every copy of the critic prompt SHALL carry the same reading rules, its minimum spot-check, a rule that it runs no test suite, the rule for picking an acceptance command, a sentence allowing a small experiment in its scratch directory to confirm a finding, and the rule that turns a claim needing a suite run or a build of the change into a finding or a question; it MUST NOT cap a claim at a number of paths and commands or forbid a clone, worktree or prototype. Each design block MUST stay byte-identical to its `docs/prompts/` copy, and each run copy SHALL differ from it only as it did on `main`.

#### Scenario: Every critic copy drops the cap and the no-build rule and keeps the rest; every writer copy keeps its rules
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); Q=$(printf '\140\140\140'); printf '%s\n' 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn' 'read that line range, not the whole file' 'to a file in your scratch directory and grep or tail it' > $T/both; { cat $T/both; echo 'Write the spec in as few writes as you can'; } > $T/spec_writer; { cat $T/both; printf '%s\n' 'Spot-check at least 2 cited paths and 1 acceptance command yourself' 'Run no test suite' 'Pick an acceptance command that runs no test suite' 'small experiment in your scratch directory' 'is a finding for the writer, or a question'; } > $T/critic; printf '%s\n' 'Ground any one claim' 'build nothing' 'no clone, worktree or prototype' > $T/gone; for r in "2. Spec writer|02-spec-writer.md|spec_writer" "3. Spec critic|03-spec-critic.md|critic"; do h=${r%%|*}; x=${r#*|}; c=${x%%|*}; f=${x#*|}; git show main:factory/prompts/$f.md > $T/a; git show main:docs/prompts/$c > $T/b; echo "$f copy=$(awk -v h="## $h" -v q="$Q" '$0==h{s=1;next} s&&$0==q"text"{p=1;next} p&&$0==q{exit} p' docs/design.md | cmp -s - docs/prompts/$c && echo SAME || echo DIFF) doc=$(tr '\n' ' ' < docs/prompts/$c | tr -s ' ' | grep -oF -f $T/$f | sort -u | grep -c .)/$(grep -c . $T/$f) run=$(tr '\n' ' ' < factory/prompts/$f.md | tr -s ' ' | grep -oF -f $T/$f | sort -u | grep -c .)/$(grep -c . $T/$f) gone=$(for g in docs/prompts/$c factory/prompts/$f.md; do tr '\n' ' ' < $g | tr -s ' ' | grep -oF -f $T/gone; done | grep -c .) fill=$([ "$(diff factory/prompts/$f.md docs/prompts/$c | grep '^[<>]')" = "$(diff $T/a $T/b | grep '^[<>]')" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `spec_writer copy=SAME doc=4/4 run=4/4 gone=0 fill=unchanged`, then `critic copy=SAME doc=8/8 run=8/8 gone=0 fill=unchanged`. `doc` and `run` count the kept or added phrases found in the documented copy and the run copy, each joined into one line so a phrase may wrap; `gone` counts the removed phrases found in either.

### Requirement: Spec writer and critic runs receive the turn-economy rules
The system prompt that `run start` writes for a spec writer run SHALL contain the writer's turn-economy rule. The one it writes for a critic run SHALL contain the critic's reading rules, its no-suite rule and the sentence allowing a small scratch experiment, and MUST NOT contain the per-claim cap or the no-build rule.

#### Scenario: A critic run's prompt has the no-suite rule and the scratch allowance, and no cap or build ban
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s; for i in 1 2; do printf "# F$i\n\nDo x.\n" > $T/req$i.md; bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req$i.md >/dev/null; done; bin/factory ticket set T-0001 status=ready-for-spec-writer >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0002 status=ready-for-critic >/dev/null; bin/factory run start --role spec_writer --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1; bin/factory run start --role critic --ticket T-0002 >/dev/null 2>&1; W=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $FACTORY_STATE/runs/run-0001-spec_writer/system-prompt.txt | tr -s ' '); C=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $FACTORY_STATE/runs/run-0002-critic/system-prompt.txt | tr -s ' '); echo "spec_writer batch=$(printf "%s" "$W" | grep -c 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn') writes=$(printf "%s" "$W" | grep -c 'Write the spec in as few writes as you can')"; echo "critic batch=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn') suite=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Run no test suite') scratch=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'small experiment in your scratch directory') cap=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Ground any one claim') build=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'build nothing')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `spec_writer batch=1 writes=1`, then `critic batch=1 suite=1 scratch=1 cap=0 build=0`

### Requirement: Nothing else in the two prompts changes
The spec writer prompt copies SHALL stay as #73 left them at `05cf8f9`. In the critic prompt copies, everything before the PROCESS section and everything from ANTI-GOODHARTING on SHALL stay byte for byte as on `main`. No other file under `docs/prompts/`, `factory/prompts/` or `agents/` SHALL change.

#### Scenario: The writer prompt is as #73 left it, and only the critic's PROCESS changes
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); n=0; for x in "docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md|1,/^PROCESS\$/p" "docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md|/^ANTI-GOODHARTING/,\$p" "factory/prompts/critic.md|1,/^PROCESS\$/p" "factory/prompts/critic.md|/^ANTI-GOODHARTING/,\$p"; do f=${x%%|*}; s=${x#*|}; git show main:$f | sed -n "$s" > $T/a; sed -n "$s" $f > $T/b; [ -s $T/a ] || n=$((n+100)); cmp -s $T/a $T/b || { n=$((n+1)); echo "changed: $f $s"; }; done; echo "sections_changed=$n writer=$(git diff --name-only 05cf8f9 HEAD -- docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md factory/prompts/spec_writer.md | grep -c .) others=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts agents | grep -vxF -e docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md -e factory/prompts/critic.md | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints only `sections_changed=0 writer=0 others=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the turn-economy change
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #73, numbered without a gap. `docs/principles.md` principle 2 SHALL name the critic's no-suite rule among its mechanisms, SHALL no longer say the critic builds nothing, and SHALL say part B.2 is done by #41 for the code reviewer and by #73 for the critic.

#### Scenario: Principle 2 names the critic's no-suite rule and no longer its build ban
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; P=$(sed -n '/^### 2\. /,/^### 3\. /p' docs/principles.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "entries73=$(grep -c '^[0-9]*\. After issue #73 ' docs/changelog.md) implemented=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'runs no test suite (#73') builds=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'builds nothing') status=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'done by #41 for the code reviewer and by #73 for the critic')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `CONTIGUOUS`, then `entries73=1 implemented=1 builds=0 status=1`

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The documents record the critic revert
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for issue #74 as its last numbered entry, numbered without a gap, that records the replay result and the two removed rules. The Spiking section of `docs/principles.md` SHALL no longer bound the critic to two paths and one command or say it does not build, SHALL say the critic may run a small scratch check, SHALL say vetting a whole approach belongs to the spec writer or a spike, and SHALL record the replay. The change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the revert as its last entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -oF -e '#74' -e replay -e 'per-claim cap' -e 'no-build rule' -e 'no test suite' -e UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR -e brace-list | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `7`

#### Scenario: The Spiking section allows a small scratch check and records the replay
- WHEN `(X=$(sed -n '/^## Spiking/,$p' docs/principles.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "bound=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'two paths, one command') nobuild=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'it does not build') scratch=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'small scratch check') whole=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'vetting a whole approach belongs to the spec writer') replay=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'replay')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `bound=0 nobuild=0 scratch=1 whole=1 replay=1`

#### Scenario: The critic revert adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

## Acceptance

Base outputs below are from `~/dev/spec-factory` at `49ea4c7` (`main`), each command run under a throwaway HOME. On the prototype (`scratch/proto`, built by `scratch/edit.py`) each scenario printed its THEN line exactly.

- Every critic copy drops the cap and the no-build rule and keeps the rest; every writer copy keeps its rules → NEW. Today the second line is `critic copy=SAME doc=7/8 run=7/8 gone=6 fill=unchanged`: the scratch-experiment phrase is missing, and the three removed phrases are found in both files. The writer line already matches; that half is a regression guard.
- A critic run's prompt has the no-suite rule and the scratch allowance, and no cap or build ban → NEW. Today the second line is `critic batch=1 suite=1 scratch=0 cap=1 build=1`.
- The writer prompt is as #73 left it, and only the critic's PROCESS changes → REGRESSION. Today it prints `sections_changed=0 writer=0 others=0`. It must still do so after the change.
- Principle 2 names the critic's no-suite rule and no longer its build ban → NEW. Today it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `entries73=1 implemented=0 builds=1 status=1`.
- The changelog records the revert as its last entry → NEW. Today it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`: entry 58 contains only `no test suite`.
- The Spiking section allows a small scratch check and records the replay → NEW. Today it prints `bound=1 nobuild=1 scratch=0 whole=0 replay=0`.
- The critic revert adds no whitespace errors → REGRESSION. Today it prints `exit=0`, because the diff is empty.

## Requirements

### Requirement: A park reason carries the failing command's error
When a store command fails and its relayed stderr is empty, the workflow scripts MUST put the refusal's JSON `error`, or else the exit code, after the reason's prefix, so that no park reason ends blank.

#### Scenario: A refused archive or sub-ticket add parks with the refusal text
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify"}}, "ticket parent-check": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify", "reuse": "run-0001-verifier"}}, "archive": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "no spec store (factory init not run)"}, "exit": 2}}'; node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-planner"}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "PLANNED"}}, "subticket add": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "ST-2: no Depends on line"}, "exit": 2}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `park: archive: no spec store (factory init not run)`, then `start: planner`, then `park: harness-bug: subticket add: ST-2: no Depends on line`

#### Scenario: A refused run start during intake parks with the refusal text
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/intake.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-triage", "round": {"spec": 0}}}, "run start": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "T-0001 is parked, not ready-for-triage"}, "exit": 2}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: triage`, then `park: harness-bug: run start triage: T-0001 is parked, not ready-for-triage`

#### Scenario: A command that prints no JSON parks with its exit code
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify"}}, "ticket parent-check": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify", "reuse": "run-0001-verifier"}}, "archive": {"raw": "", "exit": 1}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `park: archive: exit 1, no JSON on stdout`

### Requirement: The build runs only the checkers a commit still needs
When a sub-ticket reaches the checks without an implementer run in that pass, the build MUST run only the checkers that have no result row on its commit; after an implementer run it SHALL run both.

#### Scenario: A redispatched sub-ticket runs only the checker whose row was set aside
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show T-0001 ": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "planned"}}, "ticket ready-implementers": [{"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": ["T-0001.1"], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}, {"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}], "ticket show T-0001.1": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "checks-in-flight"}}, "ticket head": {"out": {"ok": true, "head": "abababababababababababababababababababab"}}, "results show": {"out": {"ok": true, "rows": {"verifier": "VERIFIED", "ci": "PASS"}, "missing": ["reviewer"]}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "APPROVE"}}, "ticket join": {"out": {"ok": true, "decision": "park", "reason": "stub stop"}}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: reviewer`, then `park: stub stop`

#### Scenario: After an implementer run both checkers run
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show T-0001 ": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "planned"}}, "ticket ready-implementers": [{"out": {"ok": true, "ready": ["T-0001.1"], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}, {"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}], "ticket show T-0001.1": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-implementer"}}, "ticket head": {"out": {"ok": true, "head": "abababababababababababababababababababab"}}, "results show": {"out": {"ok": true, "rows": {"reviewer": "REQUEST-CHANGES", "verifier": "VERIFIED", "ci": "PASS"}, "missing": []}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "READY-FOR-REVIEW"}}, "ticket join": {"out": {"ok": true, "decision": "park", "reason": "stub stop"}}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: implementer`, `start: reviewer`, `start: verifier`, `park: stub stop`, one per line

### Requirement: The workflows' clerk commands carry the dispatcher marker
Every store command that `factory/workflows/intake.js` and `factory/workflows/build.js` send to the clerk MUST carry `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` in its environment assignments, so that a dispatch SHALL still complete on a live store while its own role run is in flight.

#### Scenario: Every clerk command of both workflows carries the marker
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once.
- WHEN `(echo "intake: $(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-count.mjs factory/workflows/intake.js)"; echo "build: $(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-count.mjs factory/workflows/build.js)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `intake: sent unmarked=0`, then `build: sent unmarked=0`

#### Scenario: An intake run against a real store reaches its end with its run in flight
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once. The clerk commands run for real on a scratch instance's own store, from the checkout under test, and the triage run is in flight when the workflow records its result.
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && (cd $T/tgt && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md && $B ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null) && echo "returned=$(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-e2e.mjs $T/tgt/.factory) stored=$(cd $T/tgt && $B ticket show T-0001 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `returned=closed stored=closed`

### Requirement: An implementer starts only when each sibling-added test it may change came from a merged sibling
`factory run start --role implementer` on a sub-ticket MUST refuse with exit 2, writing no run, worktree, branch or in-flight entry, with an error that starts `BLOCKED from harness: ` and names the file, when a line `` `<file>` (added by <ID>) `` inside its "Tests to change" field names a file that existed at the parent's base, or whose first adding commit on the integration branch since that base lies inside no merged sibling's recorded merge. It SHALL accept a file a merged sibling's merge added, and SHALL ignore such a line outside that field.

#### Scenario: A test file a merged sibling added may be listed, and a mention outside Tests to change is ignored
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `git` and `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the two fixture files written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names them reuses them)

#### Scenario: A listed test that predates the plan, came from no sibling's merge, or was never added is refused before the implementer starts

- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `exit=2 blocked=1 names=1 runs=0 branch=0 ready-for-implementer`

### Requirement: The build parks a harness-blocked sub-ticket as BLOCKED, so a ruling returns it
When an implementer's run start is refused with an error that starts `BLOCKED `, the build workflow SHALL park the sub-ticket with that error, verbatim, as the reason, so that `factory resolve <id> --ruling F` MUST accept the park and return the sub-ticket to `ready-for-implementer`.

#### Scenario: The build parks the blocked sub-ticket with the harness's reason, and a ruling sends it back
Needs the GIVEN block of "A test file a merged sibling added may be listed, and a mention outside Tests to change is ignored" run once.
- WHEN `(E=tests/test_old.py; . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-sib.sh && node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-build.mjs | sed 's/\(BLOCKED from harness:\).*/\1/'; printf 'Ruling: x\n' > $T22/r.md; bin/factory resolve T-0001.2 --ruling $T22/r.md >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "ruling=$? $(bin/factory ticket show T-0001.2 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `park T-0001.2: BLOCKED from harness:`, then `ruling=0 ready-for-implementer`

### Requirement: The build asks the whole-spec step before it runs the planner
At `ready-for-planner`, `factory/workflows/build.js` MUST first run `plan whole-spec`. On `"planner": "skipped"` it SHALL move the parent to `planned` and build the sub-ticket with no planner run. On any other success it SHALL run the planner as before. On a refusal it MUST park the parent with `harness-bug: plan whole-spec: <error>`.

#### Scenario: A qualifying spec reaches its implementer with no planner run, and a refused whole-spec step parks with its error
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show T-0001 ": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-planner"}}, "plan whole-spec": {"out": {"ok": true, "planner": "skipped", "reason": "fixture", "subtickets": [{"id": "T-0001.1"}]}}, "ticket ready-implementers": [{"out": {"ok": true, "ready": ["T-0001.1"], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}, {"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}], "ticket show T-0001.1": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-implementer"}}, "ticket head": {"out": {"ok": true, "head": "abababababababababababababababababababab"}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "READY-FOR-REVIEW"}}, "ticket join": {"out": {"ok": true, "decision": "park", "reason": "stub stop"}}}'; node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-planner"}}, "plan whole-spec": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "T-0001 has no approved spec"}, "exit": 2}}')`

- THEN it prints exactly `start: planner`, then `park: harness-bug: subticket add: stub stop`

### Requirement: A role run that leaves no output is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT
When a role run ends without an output file, or with a blank one, whatever the agent call returned, `run finish` MUST record it as `EMPTY-OUTPUT` and never as `KILLED`. The workflow MUST keep the agent's non-blank last message as that run's `last-message.md` and re-dispatch the same role once. A second `EMPTY-OUTPUT` in a row SHALL park the ticket as `EMPTY-OUTPUT from <role>`, with no result row for that run.

#### Scenario: A reviewer that ends its turn waiting on its own commands is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT beside the verifier's passing rows
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `git` and `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell. This scenario needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.

- WHEN `(E=tests/test_interim.py; . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-sib.sh && node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-build.mjs; echo "implementer: $(for d in $(ls -d $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-implementer); do sed -n 's/^status: //p' $d/meta.yaml; done | tr '\n' ' ')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `park T-0001.2: EMPTY-OUTPUT from implementer`, then `implementer: EMPTY-OUTPUT EMPTY-OUTPUT `

#### Scenario: An intake role's second empty output in a row parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once. The stub store answers every `run finish` with `EMPTY-OUTPUT`.
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/intake.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-triage", "round": {"spec": 0}}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "run_id": "run-0009-x", "status": "EMPTY-OUTPUT", "escalations": []}}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: triage`, then `start: triage`, then `park: EMPTY-OUTPUT from triage`

### Requirement: A role run that writes its output runs once and routes on its STATUS
A role run whose output file holds a STATUS MUST NOT be re-dispatched, and the build SHALL route on that STATUS as before.

#### Scenario: A reviewer that writes its output runs once
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "A reviewer that ends its turn waiting on its own commands is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT beside the verifier's passing rows" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-checks.sh && node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-build.mjs '{"reviewer": [{"write": "APPROVE"}], "verifier": [{"write": "SPEC-DEFECT"}]}'; echo "reviewer: $(for d in $(ls -d $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-reviewer); do sed -n 's/^status: //p' $d/meta.yaml; done | tr '\n' ' ')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `park T-0001.1: SPEC-DEFECT from verifier`, then `reviewer: APPROVE `

## Current truth: gate-commands

# gate-commands

## Requirements

### Requirement: A gate command may declare its paths and is skipped for a sub-ticket that touches none of them
Each `gate_commands` entry SHALL be a command string or a mapping of `command` and an optional `paths` list of git pathspecs. When a reviewer or verifier run starts on a sub-ticket, the harness MUST mark SKIPPED, with its reason, each command whose paths the diff from base to head touches none of. It MUST list that command apart from the commands to run, and record it in the run's `meta.yaml`. A command with no `paths` SHALL always be listed to run.

#### Scenario: A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the fixture file written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

```sh
cat > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-sub.sh <<'EOF'
# Sourced from the repo root, with $1 the file the sub-ticket's one commit changes (docs/b.md or
# src/a.txt) and $2 `scoped` or `plain`. Builds a scratch instance and target. `scoped` gives the
# gate the unscoped command `git diff --check main...HEAD` and the command `sh -c 'exit 7'` scoped
# to `src/`; `plain` keeps the fixture's one unscoped command. Sub-ticket T-0001.1 reaches
# checks-in-flight with that commit as its head; a verifier run is started and composed on it.
# Leaves $B (the CLI), $T, $I (the implementer run), $R and $V (the verifier run and its
# directory), $H (the head) and $COMPOSE (that compose's exit code).

- THEN it prints exactly `compose=0 run=1 skipped=1 meta=1`

#### Scenario: A diff that touches a scoped command's paths runs that command
Needs the GIVEN block of "A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-sub.sh src/a.txt scoped && echo "compose=$COMPOSE run=$(grep -F 'Gate commands' $V/input.md 2>/dev/null | grep -F 'git diff --check main...HEAD' | grep -cF 'exit 7') skipped=$(grep -c '^SKIPPED' $V/input.md 2>/dev/null)")`

- THEN it prints exactly `compose=0 run=1 skipped=0`

### Requirement: A skipped command is recorded on the gate result, and the merge still needs that result to pass
When a verifier's result is recorded, the `ci` row MUST list each command that verifier run skipped, with status SKIPPED and its reason. `factory merge` SHALL still refuse unless that row is PASS.

#### Scenario: A skipped gate command is recorded on the gate result, and the merge still needs a passing gate
Needs the GIVEN block of "A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-sub.sh docs/b.md scoped && for g in FAIL PASS; do printf 'Commit: %s\nGate suite: %s\nSTATUS: VERIFIED\nCONFIDENCE: high, fixture\nESCALATIONS: none\n' $H $g > $T/v.md; printf 'Commit: %s\nSTATUS: APPROVE\nCONFIDENCE: high, fixture\nESCALATIONS: none\n' $H > $T/r.md; $B results record T-0001.1 --head $H --role verifier --output $T/v.md --run $R >/dev/null; $B results record T-0001.1 --head $H --role reviewer --output $T/r.md --run run-0003-reviewer >/dev/null; $B merge T-0001.1 >/dev/null 2>&1; m=$?; C=$T/store/results/$H/ci.yaml; echo "$g: merge=$m recorded=$(grep -q 'exit 7' $C && grep -q SKIPPED $C && echo yes || echo no)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `FAIL: merge=2 recorded=yes`, then `PASS: merge=0 recorded=yes`

### Requirement: The implementer is given every gate command
The implementer's input SHALL list every gate command to run, scoped or not, and no SKIPPED line.

#### Scenario: The implementer is still given every gate command
Needs the GIVEN block of "A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-sub.sh docs/b.md scoped && $B run compose $I >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "compose=$? both=$(grep -F 'Gate commands' $T/store/runs/$I/input.md 2>/dev/null | grep -F 'git diff --check main...HEAD' | grep -cF 'exit 7') skipped=$(grep -c '^SKIPPED' $T/store/runs/$I/input.md 2>/dev/null)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `compose=0 both=1 skipped=0`

### Requirement: A malformed gate entry refuses every build role's run start
A `gate_commands` entry MUST make `run start` refuse with exit 2 for the implementer, reviewer or verifier, naming `gate_commands` and creating no run, when it is anything other than one of these: a string; or a mapping with a non-empty string `command`, an optional non-empty list of non-empty strings `paths`, and no other key.

#### Scenario: A malformed gate entry refuses a checker's run start and creates no run
Needs the GIVEN block of "A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them" run once.
- WHEN `(for bad in '{command: "true", path: ["src/"]}' '{command: "true", paths: "src/"}'; do (. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-sub.sh docs/b.md plain && grep -v '^gate_commands:' $T/inst/instance.yaml > $T/i.yaml && echo "gate_commands: [$bad]" >> $T/i.yaml && mv $T/i.yaml $T/inst/instance.yaml && n=$(ls $T/store/runs | wc -l) && $B run start --role reviewer --ticket T-0001.1 >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? new_runs=$(( $(ls $T/store/runs | wc -l) - n )) named=$(grep -c 'gate_commands' $T/err)"); done)`

## Requirements

### Requirement: The documents record the change
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain entry 51 covering every part, numbered without a gap, `README.md` SHALL describe the new `resolve` behaviour and relative environment paths, and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the change in order
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print n, (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; sed -n '/^51\. /p' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e BLOCKED -e '--replan' -e 'next free' -e 'error text' -e redispatch -e '-whitespace' -e context.md -e relative -e uncommitted | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `51 CONTIGUOUS`, then `9`

#### Scenario: The README describes the new resolve verbs
- WHEN `(echo "replan=$(grep -c -- '--replan' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') gap=$(grep -c 'has no .resolve. verb' README.md)")`
- THEN it prints `replan=1 gap=0`

#### Scenario: The README says relative paths resolve from the caller's directory
- WHEN `(grep -c 'relative .FACTORY_' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')`
- THEN it prints `1`

#### Scenario: The change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the live-store guard
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for this change as its last numbered entry, numbered without a gap; `docs/design.md` SHALL describe the dispatcher marker and the run-directory rule; README's "Where a human decides" SHALL open with the marker's exact command form and say that the refusal deliberately does not name it; README SHALL say the final verifier run is listed as in flight and SHALL no longer say the factory's capabilities never entered the spec store; no prompt copy under `docs/prompts/` or `factory/prompts/` SHALL change; and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the guard as its last entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -oF -e FACTORY_DISPATCH -e 'in flight' -e throwaway -e 'exit 2' -e 'worktrees/' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: The design doc names the marker and the run-directory rule, and no prompt copy changes
- WHEN `(echo "design=$(grep -c FACTORY_DISPATCH docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') dirs=$(grep FACTORY_DISPATCH docs/design.md | grep -c 'worktrees/' | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') prompts=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design=1 dirs=1 prompts=0`

#### Scenario: README tells the operator how to write during a run, first thing under Where a human decides
- WHEN `(H=$(sed -n '/^## Where a human decides/,/^## What is built/p' README.md); J=$(echo "$H" | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "first=$(echo "$H" | sed -n '3p' | grep -c 'FACTORY_DISPATCH=1') command=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 [^ ]*bin/factory ') unnamed=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'deliberately does not name the marker') export=$(echo "$J" | grep -ci 'never export') rundirs=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'worktrees/')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `first=1 command=1 unnamed=1 export=1 rundirs=1`

#### Scenario: README says the final verifier run is listed as in flight
- WHEN `(R=$(tr '\n' ' ' < README.md | tr -s ' '); echo "stale=$(echo "$R" | grep -o 'does not list it as in flight' | grep -c .) listed=$(echo "$R" | grep -o 'lists it as in flight' | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `stale=0 listed=1`

#### Scenario: README no longer says the factory's capabilities never entered the spec store
- WHEN `(echo "bullet=$(grep -c 'Current truth for the factory itself' README.md) stale=$(grep -c 'never entered it' README.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `bullet=1 stale=0`

#### Scenario: The guard change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents describe the store branch
The design doc SHALL name the store branch `factory-store` and the never-tracked path rule, and the build spec SHALL call the store branch only `factory-store`. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one contiguously numbered entry recording the change. `README.md` SHALL describe committing the store on its branch, `factory store migrate`, the `git clean -ffdx` hazard and a checkout from before the move, and SHALL no longer say that a store commit moves the integration branch or give `.factory/state/` as the live store's location. The change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design doc names the store branch and the path rule
- WHEN `(Q=$(printf '\140'); echo "store_branch=$(grep -c 'factory-store' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') tickets_branch=$(grep -c "${Q}tickets${Q} branch" docs/design.md) never_tracked=$(grep -c 'never tracked' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints `store_branch=1 tickets_branch=0 never_tracked=1`

#### Scenario: The build spec calls the store branch factory-store
- WHEN `(Q=$(printf '\140'); echo "old_name=$(grep -c "${Q}tickets${Q}\|refs/heads/tickets\|HEAD:tickets" dev/build-harness.spec.md) new_name=$(grep -c 'factory-store' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints `old_name=0 new_name=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records the store branch in one contiguous entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep -E '^[0-9]+\. ' docs/changelog.md | grep 'factory-store' | grep -c 'never tracked')`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`

#### Scenario: The README describes the store branch and the move
`old_cost` joins the page into one line first, because the retired clause is wrapped across two lines. `old_refs` counts only the places that give the live store's location, so a how-to may still name the path a store moves from.
- WHEN `(Q=$(printf '\140'); echo "store_branch=$(grep -c 'factory-store' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') migrate=$(grep -c 'factory store migrate' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') ffdx=$(grep -c -- '-ffdx' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') premove=$(grep -c 'from before the move' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') old_cost=$(tr '\n' ' ' < README.md | grep -c 'committing the store to the same branch') old_refs=$(grep -c "\.factory/state/\(log\|tickets\)\|(${Q}\.factory/state/${Q})\|at ${Q}\.factory/state/${Q}" README.md)")`
- THEN it prints `store_branch=1 migrate=1 ffdx=1 premove=1 old_cost=0 old_refs=0`

#### Scenario: The store-branch change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The planner labels checks per sub-ticket and may list tests an earlier sibling added
Every copy of the planner prompt (the `docs/design.md` §4 block, `docs/prompts/04-planner.md`, `factory/prompts/planner.md`) SHALL tell the planner to label each check against the sub-ticket's own base, to name interim tests, and to list a sibling-added test as `` `<file>[::<test>]` (added by <sibling ID>): <reason> ``; it MUST no longer say to label checks "the same way", and the design block and its `docs/prompts/` copy SHALL stay byte-identical.

#### Scenario: Every planner copy labels per sub-ticket and lists sibling tests
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-planner.txt; sed -n '/^## 4\. Planner/,/^## 5\. /p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/04-planner.md factory/prompts/planner.md; do echo "own=$(grep -c "against this sub-ticket's own base" $f) sibling=$(grep -cF '(added by <sibling ID>)' $f) interim=$(grep -c '^  Interim tests: ' $f) copied=$(grep -c 'labelled NEW or REGRESSION the same way' $f)"; done; cmp -s $X docs/prompts/04-planner.md && echo verbatim || echo differs)`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `own=1 sibling=1 interim=1 copied=0`, then `verbatim`

### Requirement: The spec writer lists the tests a decision overturns, and the critic checks for one left off
Every copy of the spec writer prompt SHALL carry the RULES bullet that starts `- Tests a decision overturns: `, and every copy of the critic prompt SHALL say under rubric 1 that a test pinning the old behaviour and `missing from "Tests to change" is a finding`.

#### Scenario: Every spec writer and critic copy carries the decision-overturns rule
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-sw.txt; for h in '2\. Spec writer' '3\. Spec critic'; do sed -n "/^## $h/,/^## [0-9]/p" docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p"; done > $X; echo "design: writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' $X) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' $X)"; echo "docs/prompts: writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md)"; echo "factory/prompts: writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' factory/prompts/spec_writer.md) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' factory/prompts/critic.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design: writer=1 critic=1`, then `docs/prompts: writer=1 critic=1`, then `factory/prompts: writer=1 critic=1`

### Requirement: The preamble and the code reviewer accept a checked sibling entry
Every copy of the preamble SHALL allow an existing test listed `in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling`, and every copy of the code reviewer prompt SHALL not block a test `the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling`.

#### Scenario: Every preamble and reviewer copy accepts a sibling entry
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-pr.txt; for h in 'Shared preamble' '6\. Code reviewer'; do sed -n "/^## $h/,/^## [0-9A-Z]/p" docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p"; done > $X; echo "design: guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' $X) review=$(grep -c 'or the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling' $X)"; echo "docs/prompts: guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' docs/prompts/00-preamble.md) review=$(grep -c 'or the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling' docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md)"; echo "factory/prompts: guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' factory/prompts/preamble.md) review=$(grep -c 'or the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling' factory/prompts/reviewer.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design: guard=1 review=1`, then `docs/prompts: guard=1 review=1`, then `factory/prompts: guard=1 review=1`

### Requirement: Role runs receive the new rules
The system prompt that `run start` writes for a planner, spec writer and critic run SHALL contain that role's new rule and the new preamble sentence.

#### Scenario: Planner, spec writer and critic runs get the new rules in their system prompts
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s; for i in 1 2 3; do printf "# F$i\n\nDo x.\n" > $T/req$i.md; bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req$i.md >/dev/null; done; bin/factory ticket set T-0001 status=ready-for-planner >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0002 status=ready-for-spec-writer >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0003 status=ready-for-critic >/dev/null; for p in planner:T-0001 spec_writer:T-0002 critic:T-0003; do bin/factory run start --role ${p%%:*} --ticket ${p##*:} >/dev/null 2>&1; done; P=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-planner/system-prompt.txt); W=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-spec_writer/system-prompt.txt); C=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-critic/system-prompt.txt); echo "planner own=$(grep -c "against this sub-ticket's own base" $P) sibling=$(grep -cF '(added by <sibling ID>)' $P) guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' $P) writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' $W) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' $C)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `planner own=1 sibling=1 guard=1 writer=1 critic=1`

### Requirement: The documents record the sibling-tests check
`docs/design.md` SHALL describe the check in a paragraph that starts `**Tests a sibling added.**`, in piece 8 and in the spec approval gate row, and SHALL no longer call the gate's list the only authorization to alter an existing test; `dev/build-harness.spec.md` SHALL name the `BLOCKED from harness` refusal; `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain an entry for issue #40 and stay numbered without a gap; `README.md` SHALL describe the check and the new `--ruling` case; and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design doc and build spec describe the check
- WHEN `(echo "piece8=$(grep '^| 8 |' docs/design.md | grep -c 'added by that sibling') gate=$(grep '^| Spec approval |' docs/design.md | grep -c 'a test an earlier sibling added') stale=$(grep -c 'which is the only authorization to alter an existing test' docs/design.md) check=$(grep -c '^\*\*Tests a sibling added\.\*\*.*BLOCKED from harness:' docs/design.md) build=$(grep -c 'BLOCKED from harness' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `piece8=1 gate=1 stale=0 check=1 build=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records issue 40's change without a numbering gap
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\.

- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: README describes the sibling tests check and its ruling
- WHEN `(echo "built=$(grep -c '^- \*\*Sibling tests check\.\*\*' README.md) ruling=$(grep '^| \*\*Unstick\*\*' README.md | grep -c 'a test no merged sibling added')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `built=1 ruling=1`

#### Scenario: The sibling-tests change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the declared-path rule
The "## 5. Implementer" and "## 7. Verifier" blocks of `docs/design.md` SHALL carry the declared-path rule and stay verbatim copies of `docs/prompts/05-implementer.md` and `docs/prompts/07-verifier.md`. The run copies under `factory/prompts/` SHALL differ from those files only by the fills they had on `main`. The code reviewer and preamble copies MUST NOT change. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for issue #49, numbered without a gap, and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design blocks and their copies carry the rule and stay in step
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); Q=$(printf '\140\140\140'); for r in "5. Implementer|05-implementer.md|implementer" "7.

- THEN it prints exactly `implementer copy=SAME rule=1 fill=unchanged`, then `verifier copy=SAME rule=1 fill=unchanged`. `copy=SAME`: the design block equals its `docs/prompts/` file. `rule=1`: that file carries the rule. `fill=unchanged`: the run copy under `factory/prompts/` differs from the documented copy only where it did on `main`.

#### Scenario: The code reviewer and preamble copies do not change
- WHEN `(echo "changed=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- factory/prompts/reviewer.md factory/prompts/preamble.md docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md docs/prompts/00-preamble.md | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `changed=0`

#### Scenario: The changelog records the declared-path rule in a contiguous entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep -E '^[0-9]+\. ' docs/changelog.md | grep -F '#49' | grep -c 'ESCALATIONS')`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`

#### Scenario: The declared-path change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the small-change lane
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for this change as its last numbered entry, numbered without a gap. `docs/design.md`, `dev/build-harness.spec.md` and `README.md` SHALL describe the whole-spec sub-ticket and gate-command paths. No prompt copy SHALL change, and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the small-change lane as its last entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -oF -e 'paths' -e SKIPPED -e 'plan whole-spec' -e NEEDS-SPLIT -e seams | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: The design doc, build spec and README describe both skips, and no prompt copy changes
- WHEN `(echo "design=$(grep -c 'whole-spec' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') gate=$(grep '^| 11 | Gate runner' docs/design.md | grep -c 'SKIPPED') build=$(grep -c 'plan whole-spec' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') readme=$(grep -c 'plan whole-spec' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') skipped=$(grep -c 'SKIPPED' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') stale=$(grep -c 'The build workflow runs the planner, which' README.md) prompts=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts agents | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design=1 gate=1 build=1 readme=1 skipped=1 stale=0 prompts=0`

#### Scenario: The small-change lane adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: Every role is told to wait for its own commands
Every copy of the shared preamble SHALL carry the bullet that starts `- Run every command in the foreground and wait for it to finish.` and says `Never end your turn while a command you started is still running`. The design block and both files MUST stay byte-identical, and every role run's system prompt SHALL carry the bullet.

#### Scenario: Every preamble copy carries the wait rule and the copies stay identical
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-pre.txt; sed -n '/^## Shared preamble/,/^## [0-9]/p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/00-preamble.md factory/prompts/preamble.md; do echo "fg=$(grep -c '^- Run every command in the foreground and wait for it to finish\.$' $f) end=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $f | tr -s ' ' | grep -c 'Never end your turn while a command you started is still running')"; done; cmp -s $X docs/prompts/00-preamble.md && cmp -s docs/prompts/00-preamble.md factory/prompts/preamble.md && echo verbatim || echo differs)`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `fg=1 end=1`, then `verbatim`

#### Scenario: Implementer, reviewer and verifier run prompts carry the wait rule, and only the reviewer's carries the judge-the-diff rule
Needs the GIVEN block of "Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh && for r in implementer reviewer verifier; do P=$(prompt $r); echo "$r fg=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'Never end your turn while a command you started is still running') judge=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'Do not run the test suite or the gate commands')"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer fg=1 judge=0`, `reviewer fg=1 judge=1`, `verifier fg=1 judge=0`, one per line

### Requirement: The code reviewer judges the diff and leaves the suite and the gate to the verifier
Every copy of the code reviewer prompt SHALL say `Do not run the test suite or the gate commands: the verifier runs them on the same head`, and SHALL allow a narrow command that confirms a specific finding. No existing line of that prompt MAY be removed, and the verifier prompt MUST NOT change. The reviewer's composed input MUST NOT list the gate commands, while the implementer's and the verifier's inputs still SHALL.

#### Scenario: Every reviewer copy carries the rule, keeps every existing line, and the verifier prompt is unchanged
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-rev.txt; T=$(mktemp -d); sed -n '/^## 6\. Code reviewer/,/^## 7\. /p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md factory/prompts/reviewer.md; do J=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $f | tr -s ' '); echo "judge=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'Do not run the test suite or the gate commands: the verifier runs them on the same head') narrow=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'You may run a narrow command to confirm a specific finding')"; done; git show main:factory/prompts/reviewer.md > $T/a; git show main:docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md > $T/b; echo "copy=$(cmp -s $X docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md && echo SAME || echo DIFF) fill=$([ "$(diff factory/prompts/reviewer.md docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md | grep '^[<>]')" = "$(diff $T/a $T/b | grep '^[<>]')" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed) removed=$(git diff main...HEAD -- docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md factory/prompts/reviewer.md | grep -v '^---' | grep -c '^-') verifier_changed=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts/07-verifier.md factory/prompts/verifier.md | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `judge=1 narrow=1`, then `copy=SAME fill=unchanged removed=0 verifier_changed=0`

#### Scenario: The reviewer's input no longer hands it the gate commands, and the implementer's and verifier's still do
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "A reviewer that ends its turn waiting on its own commands is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT beside the verifier's passing rows" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-checks.sh && for r in reviewer verifier implementer; do [ $r = implementer ] && bin/factory ticket set T-0001.1 status=ready-for-implementer 'in_flight=[]' >/dev/null; R=$(bin/factory run start --role $r --ticket T-0001.1 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'); bin/factory run compose ${R:-none} >/dev/null 2>&1; I=$FACTORY_STATE/runs/${R:-none}/input.md; echo "$r gates=$(grep -c 'Gate commands (run each from your worktree' $I 2>/dev/null) told=$(grep -c 'The verifier runs the gate commands on this head; you do not run them' $I 2>/dev/null)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `reviewer gates=0 told=1`, `verifier gates=1 told=0`, `implementer gates=1 told=0`, one per line

### Requirement: The documents record the empty-output route
`docs/design.md` SHALL state the EMPTY-OUTPUT rule and its two routing-table rows, and SHALL list a second EMPTY-OUTPUT among the park reasons. `dev/build-harness.spec.md` SHALL describe EMPTY-OUTPUT and `run last-message`, and SHALL no longer describe a KILLED condition or seam. `README.md` SHALL no longer say that a run is parked for exceeding a budget, and SHALL describe the empty-output retry. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain an entry for issue #41, numbered without a gap. The change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design doc states the EMPTY-OUTPUT rule, its rows and its park
- WHEN `(echo "rule=$(grep -c '^- A role run that ends without writing its output is EMPTY-OUTPUT' docs/design.md) rows=$(grep -c '^| Any role | EMPTY-OUTPUT' docs/design.md) parks=$(grep '^- A non-empty ESCALATIONS line' docs/design.md | grep -c 'a second EMPTY-OUTPUT in a row') kill=$(grep -c 'never recorded as a budget kill' docs/design.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `rule=1 rows=2 parks=1 kill=1`

#### Scenario: The build spec describes EMPTY-OUTPUT and no longer a KILLED condition
- WHEN `(echo "stale=$(grep -c 'KILLED condition\|KILLED seam' dev/build-harness.spec.md) empty=$(grep -c 'EMPTY-OUTPUT' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') note=$(grep -c 'run last-message' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `stale=0 empty=1 note=1`

#### Scenario: README drops the budget park and describes the empty-output retry
- WHEN `(echo "budget=$(grep -c 'exceeding its budget\|over budget' README.md) built=$(grep -c '^- \*\*Empty output\.\*\*' README.md) unstick=$(grep '^| \*\*Unstick\*\*' README.md | grep -c 'ended without output twice')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `budget=0 built=1 unstick=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records issue 41 without a numbering gap
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #41 ' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e EMPTY-OUTPUT -e foreground -e 'last message' -e 're-dispatched once' -e 'gate commands' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: The empty-output change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The spec writer and the critic carry the turn-economy rules
Every copy of the spec writer prompt SHALL tell it to batch independent reads and commands, read line ranges once grep has found them, keep long output in a scratch file, and write the spec in as few writes as it can. Every copy of the critic prompt SHALL carry the same reading rules, cap any one claim at 2 paths and 1 command, forbid test-suite runs and builds, and turn a claim that needs one into a finding or a question. Each design block MUST stay byte-identical to its `docs/prompts/` copy, and each run copy SHALL differ from it only as it did on `main`.

#### Scenario: Every spec writer and critic copy carries the turn-economy rules and the critic's no-build rule
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); Q=$(printf '\140\140\140'); printf '%s\n' 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn' 'read that line range, not the whole file' 'to a file in your scratch directory and grep or tail it' > $T/both; { cat $T/both; echo 'Write the spec in as few writes as you can'; } > $T/spec_writer; { cat $T/both; printf '%s\n' 'Ground any one claim with at most 2 paths and 1 command' 'Run no test suite and build nothing' 'is a finding for the writer, or a question'; } > $T/critic; for r in "2. Spec writer|02-spec-writer.md|spec_writer" "3. Spec critic|03-spec-critic.md|critic"; do h=${r%%|*}; x=${r#*|}; c=${x%%|*}; f=${x#*|}; git show main:factory/prompts/$f.md > $T/a; git show main:docs/prompts/$c > $T/b; echo "$f copy=$(awk -v h="## $h" -v q="$Q" '$0==h{s=1;next} s&&$0==q"text"{p=1;next} p&&$0==q{exit} p' docs/design.md | cmp -s - docs/prompts/$c && echo SAME || echo DIFF) doc=$(tr '\n' ' ' < docs/prompts/$c | tr -s ' ' | grep -oF -f $T/$f | sort -u | grep -c .)/$(grep -c . $T/$f) run=$(tr '\n' ' ' < factory/prompts/$f.md | tr -s ' ' | grep -oF -f $T/$f | sort -u | grep -c .)/$(grep -c . $T/$f) fill=$([ "$(diff factory/prompts/$f.md docs/prompts/$c | grep '^[<>]')" = "$(diff $T/a $T/b | grep '^[<>]')" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `spec_writer copy=SAME doc=4/4 run=4/4 fill=unchanged`, then `critic copy=SAME doc=6/6 run=6/6 fill=unchanged`. `doc` and `run` count the rule phrases found in the documented copy and the run copy, each joined into one line so a phrase may wrap.

### Requirement: Spec writer and critic runs receive the turn-economy rules
The system prompt that `run start` writes for a spec writer run SHALL contain the writer's turn-economy rule, and the one it writes for a critic run SHALL contain the critic's reading rules, its per-claim cap and its no-suite, no-build rule.

#### Scenario: Spec writer and critic run prompts carry the new rules
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s; for i in 1 2; do printf "# F$i\n\nDo x.\n" > $T/req$i.md; bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req$i.md >/dev/null; done; bin/factory ticket set T-0001 status=ready-for-spec-writer >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0002 status=ready-for-critic >/dev/null; bin/factory run start --role spec_writer --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1; bin/factory run start --role critic --ticket T-0002 >/dev/null 2>&1; W=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $FACTORY_STATE/runs/run-0001-spec_writer/system-prompt.txt | tr -s ' '); C=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $FACTORY_STATE/runs/run-0002-critic/system-prompt.txt | tr -s ' '); echo "spec_writer batch=$(printf "%s" "$W" | grep -c 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn') writes=$(printf "%s" "$W" | grep -c 'Write the spec in as few writes as you can')"; echo "critic batch=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn') suite=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Run no test suite and build nothing') cap=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Ground any one claim with at most 2 paths and 1 command')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `spec_writer batch=1 writes=1`, then `critic batch=1 suite=1 cap=1`

### Requirement: Nothing else in the two prompts changes
The change MUST NOT remove or alter any existing line of the spec writer or critic prompt copies. The critic's RUBRIC, CONVERGENCE and OUTPUT sections and the writer's ROLE, INPUT, PROCESS and FORMAT sections SHALL stay byte for byte as on `main`, and no other file under `docs/prompts/`, `factory/prompts/` or `agents/` SHALL change.

#### Scenario: Rubric, round limit, format and every other prompt are unchanged
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); n=0; for x in "docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md|1,/^RULES\$/p" "docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md|/^FORMAT\$/,\$p" "factory/prompts/spec_writer.md|1,/^RULES\$/p" "factory/prompts/spec_writer.md|/^FORMAT\$/,\$p" "docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md|1,/^PROCESS\$/p" "docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md|/^ANTI-GOODHARTING/,\$p" "factory/prompts/critic.md|1,/^PROCESS\$/p" "factory/prompts/critic.md|/^ANTI-GOODHARTING/,\$p"; do f=${x%%|*}; s=${x#*|}; git show main:$f | sed -n "$s" > $T/a; sed -n "$s" $f > $T/b; [ -s $T/a ] || n=$((n+100)); cmp -s $T/a $T/b || { n=$((n+1)); echo "changed: $f $s"; }; done; echo "sections_changed=$n removed=$(git diff main...HEAD -- docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md factory/prompts/spec_writer.md factory/prompts/critic.md | grep -v '^---' | grep -c '^-') others=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts agents | grep -vxF -e docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md -e docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md -e factory/prompts/spec_writer.md -e factory/prompts/critic.md | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints only `sections_changed=0 removed=0 others=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the turn-economy change
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for issue #73 as its last numbered entry, numbered without a gap. `docs/principles.md` principle 2 SHALL name the critic's new rule among its mechanisms and SHALL say part B.2 is done by #41 for the code reviewer and by #73 for the critic. The change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog and the principles page record the change
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -oF -e '#73' -e 'line range' -e 'scratch directory' -e 'no test suite' -e 'two paths and one command' | sort -u | grep -c .; P=$(sed -n '/^### 2\. /,/^### 3\. /p' docs/principles.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "implemented=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'runs no test suite and builds nothing (#73, .factory/prompts/critic.md.)') status=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'done by #41 for the code reviewer and by #73 for the critic')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`, then `implemented=1 status=1`

#### Scenario: The turn-economy change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

## Current truth: harness-suite

# harness-suite

## Requirements

### Requirement: The harness suite runs mid-edit without loosening the lock
The harness's own test suite SHALL pass in a checkout that has an uncommitted edit under a harness path, and a store command on an instance's own store run from such a checkout MUST still be refused.

#### Scenario: The harness suite passes with an uncommitted harness edit
The command gives pytest its own temporary directory under `/tmp`, because four existing tests need one outside every repository and instance. Run it as written, whatever `TMPDIR` the caller has set; it removes that directory when it ends.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && P=$(mktemp -d /tmp/t0023-suite.XXXXXX) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && echo '# uncommitted edit' >> $T/c/factory/status.py && cd $T/c && TMPDIR=$P .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | tail -1; rm -rf "$P")`
- THEN it prints one line reporting a number of passed tests and no `failed` or `error`

#### Scenario: The uncommitted-edit refusal still holds on an instance's own store
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && echo '# uncommitted edit' >> $T/c/factory/status.py && git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $T/c/bin/factory init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && $T/c/bin/factory config >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$?"; head -1 $T/err | grep -o 'has uncommitted changes:$')`
- THEN it prints `exit=2`, then `has uncommitted changes:`

## Current truth: human-resolution

# human-resolution

## Requirements

### Requirement: A ruling returns a BLOCKED sub-ticket to its implementer
`factory resolve <id> --ruling F` on a park whose reason starts with `BLOCKED` MUST write F as the ticket's next ruling, return it to `ready-for-implementer` at the same round, and the next implementer input SHALL contain the ruling.

#### Scenario: A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.

A ruling on a critic ESCALATE park SHALL still return the ticket to `ready-for-critic`.

#### Scenario: A ruling on a critic ESCALATE still returns the ticket to the critic

### Requirement: A redispatch sets aside only rows that did not pass
`factory resolve <id> --redispatch` MUST keep a reviewer row that is `APPROVE`, and the verifier and gate rows together when they are `VERIFIED` and `PASS`, and SHALL move every other row of that commit to `superseded-<n>/`.

# live-store-guard

## Requirements

### Requirement: Unmarked writes to a live store are refused while a role run is in flight there
While any run is in flight on an instance's own store, every `factory` command on that store except `ticket show`, `ticket join`, `results show`, `config`, `status parse`, `log tail` and `paths` (and any command given `--accept-harness`) MUST be refused with exit 2, writing nothing to the store, the instance or the repository, unless its environment has `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1`; the refusal SHALL name a throwaway `FACTORY_STATE` and SHALL NOT name the marker.

#### Scenario: Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the three fixture files written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names them reuses them)

- THEN it prints exactly `accept=2 store=unchanged`

### Requirement: Writes from inside a store's run directories or code checkouts are refused, marked or not
Every `factory` command on an instance's own store except the read-only list above MUST be refused with exit 2, writing nothing, when the caller's directory lies under that store's `runs/` or `worktrees/`, whether or not its environment has `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` and whether or not any run is in flight.

#### Scenario: Marked writes from a run's scratch directory or a worktree directory are refused, init included
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once.

- THEN it prints exactly `idle=1 new=2 decision=2 store=unchanged`

### Requirement: Reads, marked commands from outside the store, throwaway stores and idle stores stay open
While a run is in flight on the live store, the read-only commands SHALL succeed from anywhere, a command with `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` run from outside the store's `runs/` and `worktrees/` SHALL succeed as before, and a command on a throwaway store (`FACTORY_STATE` naming another store) SHALL NOT be fenced from any directory; with no run in flight, unmarked writes from outside those directories SHALL succeed as before.

- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-inflight.sh && (cd $T/tgt && FACTORY_STATE=$T/s $B init >/dev/null 2>&1); i=$?; cd $W && FACTORY_STATE=$T/s $B ticket new --file $T/req2.md >/dev/null 2>&1; n=$?; echo "init=$i new=$n")`
- THEN it prints exactly `init=0 new=0`

#### Scenario: With no run in flight, unmarked commands write as before
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once.

- THEN it prints exactly `new=0 decision=0`

### Requirement: The marker does not lift the harness lock
A command with `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` on an instance's own store MUST still be refused by the harness lock's uncommitted-edit check, with exit 2 and nothing written, whether or not a run is in flight.

#### Scenario: A marked write from a harness checkout with an uncommitted edit is still refused
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $T/c/bin/factory init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md && $T/c/bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null && $T/c/bin/factory run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null && echo '# uncommitted edit' >> $T/c/factory/status.py && S0=$(find $T/tgt/.factory -type f -exec cksum {} + | sort | cksum) && FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 $T/c/bin/factory decision add T-0001 x >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? lock=$(head -1 $T/err | grep -c 'has uncommitted changes:$') store=$([ "$(find $T/tgt/.factory -type f -exec cksum {} + | sort | cksum)" = "$S0" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `exit=2 lock=1 store=unchanged`

## Current truth: merge-gate

# merge-gate

## Requirements

### Requirement: A store commit does not hold back a merge
On an instance whose store is the checkout of `factory-store`, a store commit made after a sub-ticket's checks SHALL NOT stop `factory merge` from merging that sub-ticket.

#### Scenario: A sub-ticket merges after a store commit
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-gate.sh && git -C .factory/state add -A && git -C .factory/state commit -q -m "store: rows recorded"; $B merge T-0001 >/dev/null 2>$T25/err; echo "exit=$? refused=$(grep -c 'head does not contain main' $T25/err)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=0 refused=0`

### Requirement: A commit to the integration branch still holds back a merge
`factory merge` MUST still refuse, with `head does not contain main`, a sub-ticket whose head does not contain a commit made to the integration branch after its checks.

#### Scenario: A sub-ticket is refused after a code commit to main
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-gate.sh && echo y > y.txt && git add y.txt && git commit -q -m "code on main"; $B merge T-0001 >/dev/null 2>$T25/err; echo "exit=$? refused=$(grep -c 'head does not contain main' $T25/err)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 refused=1`

## Current truth: role-escalations

# role-escalations

## Requirements

### Requirement: The implementer and verifier leave declared protected paths out of ESCALATIONS
The system prompt of every implementer and verifier run SHALL say that a protected path the sub-ticket declares is not an escalation, that the code reviewer lists declared paths once for each head it reviews, that the role may name them but not under ESCALATIONS, and that a protected path the sub-ticket does not declare still goes under ESCALATIONS.

#### Scenario: Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the fixture file written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

```sh
cat > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh <<'EOF'
# Sourced from the repo root of the checkout under test. Defines `prompt <role>`: starts one run of

- THEN it prints exactly `implementer declared=1 notunder=1 undeclared=1`, then `verifier declared=1 notunder=1 undeclared=1`

### Requirement: Every role still escalates an undeclared protected path, and the code reviewer still lists declared ones
The system prompts of implementer, code reviewer and verifier runs MUST still carry the preamble's rule to escalate a protected path that the approved spec's Risk section does not declare, and the code reviewer's prompt MUST still carry check 6 unchanged.

#### Scenario: All three run prompts keep the undeclared-path rule and the reviewer keeps check 6
Needs the GIVEN block of "Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh && u="a protected path the approved spec's Risk section does not declare"; for r in implementer reviewer verifier; do echo "$r undeclared=$(prompt $r | grep -cF "$u")"; done; echo "check6=$(prompt reviewer | grep -cF '6. Protected paths touched? If the sub-ticket does not declare them, ESCALATE. If it does, list them under ESCALATIONS')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer undeclared=1`, `reviewer undeclared=1`, `verifier undeclared=1`, `check6=1`, one per line

## Current truth: store-setup

# store-setup

## Requirements

### Requirement: Run records are exempt from whitespace checks
A store that `init` or `run start` has touched MUST hold a `.gitattributes` with the line `runs/** -whitespace`, so that `git diff --check` SHALL NOT report run records while it still reports every other store file.

#### Scenario: Run records in a store pass whitespace checks and other store files do not
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && git init -q -b main $T/r && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && FACTORY_STATE=$T/r/store bin/factory init >/dev/null && git -C $T/r add -A && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q -m store && mkdir -p $T/r/store/runs/run-0001-verifier && printf 'context \n x\n' > $T/r/store/runs/run-0001-verifier/diff.patch && git -C $T/r add -A && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q -m record && git -C $T/r diff --check HEAD~1 HEAD >/dev/null; echo "runs=$?"; printf 'x \n' > $T/r/store/notes.md && git -C $T/r add -A && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q -m notes && git -C $T/r diff --check HEAD~1 HEAD >/dev/null; echo "other=$?")`
- THEN it prints `runs=0`, then `other=2`

#### Scenario: A run start adds the whitespace rule to an existing store
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && bin/factory run start --role planner --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null && echo "rule=$(cat $FACTORY_STATE/.gitattributes 2>/dev/null | grep -cxF 'runs/** -whitespace')")`
- THEN it prints `rule=1`

### Requirement: No half instance, and a missing briefing refuses
`factory init` MUST refuse with exit 2, writing nothing, when it would create an instance while `FACTORY_STATE` names another store; `run compose` MUST refuse with exit 2, writing no input, when the instance has no `context.md`.

#### Scenario: init refuses to create an instance on a throwaway store and writes nothing
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && FACTORY_STATE=$T/s $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? instance=$([ -e $T/tgt/.factory ] && echo written || echo none) store=$([ -e $T/s ] && echo written || echo none) names_state=$(grep -c FACTORY_STATE $T/err)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 instance=none store=none names_state=1`

#### Scenario: A missing briefing refuses the compose with exit 2
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && rm .factory/context.md && export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md && $B ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null && $B run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null && $B run compose run-0001-triage >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? input=$([ -e $T/s/runs/run-0001-triage/input.md ] && echo written || echo none) names_context=$(grep -c 'context.md' $T/err)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 input=none names_context=1`

### Requirement: Relative environment paths resolve from the caller's directory
A relative `FACTORY_STATE`, `FACTORY_INSTANCE` or `FACTORY_REPO` MUST resolve against the directory the command was run from; an absolute value SHALL be used as given.

#### Scenario: Relative FACTORY_STATE, FACTORY_INSTANCE and FACTORY_REPO resolve against the caller's directory
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; F=$(cd tests/factory/fixtures/instance && pwd -P); s=$(cd $T && FACTORY_INSTANCE=$F FACTORY_STATE=rel/store $B paths | tail -1); i=$(cd $F/.. && FACTORY_INSTANCE=instance $B paths | tail -1); r=$(cd $T && FACTORY_INSTANCE=$F FACTORY_REPO=rel $B paths | tail -1); echo "state=$(echo "$s" | grep -cF "\"state\": \"$T/rel/store\"") instance=$(echo "$i" | grep -cF "\"instance\": \"$F\"") repo=$(echo "$r" | grep -cF "\"state\": \"$T/rel/.factory/state\"")")`
- THEN it prints `state=1 instance=1 repo=1`

#### Scenario: An absolute FACTORY_STATE is used as given
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; F=$(cd tests/factory/fixtures/instance && pwd -P); cd / && echo "absolute=$(FACTORY_INSTANCE=$F FACTORY_STATE=$T/abs $B paths | tail -1 | grep -cF "\"state\": \"$T/abs\"")")`
- THEN it prints `absolute=1`

### Requirement: A new instance's store is a checkout of its own branch
`factory init` SHALL create a missing own store as a git worktree of branch `factory-store`, which the integration checkout does not see. It SHALL check that branch out when it already exists locally or on exactly one remote, so that a store commit never moves the integration branch.

#### Scenario: init creates the store on the factory-store branch, out of the integration checkout's sight
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "branch=$(git -C .factory/state symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>/dev/null) seen_by_main=$(git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all | grep -c '^?? .factory/state/')")`
- THEN it prints `branch=factory-store seen_by_main=0`

#### Scenario: init on a clone restores the store from the pushed branch
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); B=$PWD/bin/factory; export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=f GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=f@x GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=f GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=f@x; git init -q -b main $T/src && cd $T/src && git commit -q --allow-empty -m init && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && git add -A && git commit -q -m instance && git -C .factory/state add -A && git -C .factory/state commit -q -m "store: first" && git clone -q $T/src $T/c && cd $T/c && rm -rf .factory/state && $B init >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$? branch=$(git -C .factory/state symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>/dev/null) restored=$(ls .factory/state/decisions.md 2>/dev/null | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=0 branch=factory-store restored=1`

### Requirement: init refuses when more than one remote carries the store branch
`factory init` MUST refuse with exit 2, creating no store and no local branch, when the own store is missing, no local `factory-store` exists and more than one remote carries it; the refusal MUST name each `<remote>/factory-store`.

#### Scenario: init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both
- GIVEN the three fixture files written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown. Every later scenario of this change that names them reuses them.

- THEN it prints `exit=2 store=none local_branch=0 names=1,1`

### Requirement: init refuses to run from inside the store checkout
`factory init`, run with `FACTORY_INSTANCE` unset from a directory whose git top level is a checkout of `factory-store`, or is the store of the instance found from that directory or a checkout of the same repository inside that store, MUST refuse with exit 2 and write nothing, whichever commit the store has checked out, so that it never creates an instance inside the live store; other commands run from there SHALL still find the live instance, and `init` in a separate repository under the store SHALL still create that repository's instance.

#### Scenario: init from a scratch directory inside the store checkout refuses and leaves the store unchanged
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-b1.sh && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T25/r.md && $B ticket new --file $T25/r.md >/dev/null && $B run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1 && git -C .factory/state status --porcelain --untracked-files=all > $T25/before && cd .factory/state/runs/run-0001-triage/scratch && $B init --repo-name x >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$? phantom=$([ -e $T25/tgt/.factory/state/.factory ] && echo written || echo none) store=$(git -C $T25/tgt/.factory/state status --porcelain --untracked-files=all | cmp -s $T25/before - && echo unchanged || echo changed)"; echo "found=$($B ticket show T-0001 2>/dev/null | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 phantom=none store=unchanged`, then `found=ready-for-triage`

#### Scenario: init from the store checkout on a detached HEAD refuses
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-b1.sh && git -C .factory/state add -A && git -C .factory/state commit -q -m "store: first" && git -C .factory/state checkout -q --detach && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T25/r.md && $B ticket new --file $T25/r.md >/dev/null && $B run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1 && git -C .factory/state status --porcelain --untracked-files=all > $T25/before && cd .factory/state/runs/run-0001-triage/scratch && $B init --repo-name x >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$? detached=$(git -C $T25/tgt/.factory/state symbolic-ref -q HEAD >/dev/null && echo no || echo yes) phantom=$([ -e $T25/tgt/.factory/state/.factory ] && echo written || echo none) store=$(git -C $T25/tgt/.factory/state status --porcelain --untracked-files=all | cmp -s $T25/before - && echo unchanged || echo changed)"; echo "found=$($B ticket show T-0001 2>/dev/null | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 detached=yes phantom=none store=unchanged`, then `found=ready-for-triage`

#### Scenario: init in a separate repository under a run's scratch directory still creates its instance
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-b1.sh && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T25/r.md && $B ticket new --file $T25/r.md >/dev/null && $B run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1 && cd .factory/state/runs/run-0001-triage/scratch && git init -q -b main other && cd other && git commit -q --allow-empty -m init && $B init --repo-name other >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$? instance=$([ -f .factory/instance.yaml ] && echo written || echo none) live=$(cd $T25/tgt && $B ticket show T-0001 2>/dev/null | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints `exit=0 instance=written live=ready-for-triage`

### Requirement: init refuses a store path the integration branch has tracked
`factory init` MUST refuse with exit 2, writing nothing and naming the path, when it would create the own store at a path under which the integration branch has ever tracked a file.

#### Scenario: init refuses a once-tracked store path and writes nothing
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); B=$PWD/bin/factory; export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=f GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=f@x GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=f GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=f@x; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && cd $T/tgt && mkdir -p .factory/state && echo old > .factory/state/old.md && git add -A && git commit -q -m "old store" && git rm -q -r .factory/state && git commit -q -m "store removed" && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? instance=$([ -e .factory ] && echo written || echo none) names_path=$(grep -q '\.factory/state' $T/err && echo 1 || echo 0)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 instance=none names_path=1`

### Requirement: store migrate moves a tracked store onto its branch and keeps every record
`factory store migrate --to PATH` on an idle, fully committed own store that is tracked on the integration branch SHALL do all of the following:
- put the store's last committed tree on a new `factory-store` branch, checked out at PATH;
- copy the store's ignored run files to PATH, and verify the copy before removing anything;
- untrack and remove the old path;
- set `state_dir` to PATH, so that later commands use the moved store.

#### Scenario: store migrate carries the store to factory-store at the new path
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-old.sh && mkdir -p .factory/state/runs/run-0001-triage/scratch && echo n > .factory/state/runs/run-0001-triage/scratch/n.txt && $B store migrate --to .factory/store >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$?"; echo "branch=$(git -C .factory/store symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>/dev/null) same_tree=$([ "$(git rev-parse -q --verify 'factory-store^{tree}')" = "$(git rev-parse $PRE:.factory/state)" ] && echo yes || echo no) scratch=$(cat .factory/store/runs/run-0001-triage/scratch/n.txt 2>/dev/null) old=$([ -e .factory/state ] && echo kept || echo gone) main_tracks=$(git ls-files .factory/state | grep -c .) seen_by_main=$(git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all | grep -c '^?? .factory/store/')"; echo "state_dir=$(sed -n 's/^state_dir: *//p' .factory/instance.yaml) ticket=$($B ticket show T-0001 2>/dev/null | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints `exit=0`, then `branch=factory-store same_tree=yes scratch=n old=gone main_tracks=0 seen_by_main=0`, then `state_dir=.factory/store ticket=ready-for-triage`

### Requirement: store migrate refuses while the store is in use or uncommitted
`factory store migrate` MUST refuse with exit 2, creating no branch and no new path, when a store file is uncommitted or a run is in flight. The refusal MUST name the uncommitted files or the runs in flight.

#### Scenario: store migrate refuses an uncommitted store and a run in flight
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-old.sh && echo edit >> .factory/state/decisions.md; $B store migrate --to .factory/store >/dev/null 2>$T25/e1; echo "uncommitted: exit=$? names=$(grep -c 'decisions.md' $T25/e1) branch=$(git branch --list factory-store | grep -c .)"; git checkout -q -- .factory/state/decisions.md && $B run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1 && git add -A && git commit -q -m "run started"; FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 $B store migrate --to .factory/store >/dev/null 2>$T25/e2; echo "in flight: exit=$? names=$(grep -c 'run-0001-triage' $T25/e2) branch=$(git branch --list factory-store | grep -c .) new=$([ -e .factory/store ] && echo written || echo none)")`
- THEN it prints `uncommitted: exit=2 names=1 branch=0`, then `in flight: exit=2 names=1 branch=0 new=none`

### Requirement: A checkout of an older commit leaves a moved store untouched
After `store migrate`, checking out a commit from before the move in the integration checkout, and then checking out the integration branch again, MUST leave every file of the moved store as it was, uncommitted ones included.

#### Scenario: A checkout of an older commit leaves the moved store untouched
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-old.sh && $B store migrate --to .factory/store >/dev/null 2>&1 && git commit -q -a -m "store moved to its branch"; (echo live > .factory/store/live.md) 2>/dev/null; git checkout -q $PRE 2>/dev/null && git checkout -q main 2>/dev/null; echo "live=$(cat .factory/store/live.md 2>/dev/null || echo lost) on=$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)")`
- THEN it prints `live=live on=main`

## Current truth: sub-ticket-planning

# sub-ticket-planning

## Requirements

### Requirement: A later plan's sub-tickets continue the parent's numbering
`factory subticket add` on a parent that already has sub-tickets MUST number the new ones from the next free index, SHALL accept a `Depends on:` line naming an existing sub-ticket, and MUST refuse a plan whose head line reuses an existing sub-ticket's id, writing nothing.

#### Scenario: A later plan's sub-tickets take the next free ids and may depend on a merged sibling
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-closed.sh && printf 'ST-1 / Fix the bypass\nDepends on: T-0001.2\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan2.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan2.md 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | grep -o '"id": "[^"]*"\|"depends_on": \[[^]]*\]'; bin/factory ticket ready-implementers T-0001 | tail -1 | grep -o '"ready": \[[^]]*\]')`
- THEN it prints `"id": "T-0001.3"`, then `"depends_on": ["T-0001.2"]`, then `"ready": ["T-0001.3"]`

#### Scenario: A plan that reuses an existing sub-ticket id is refused and writes nothing
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-closed.sh && printf 'T-0001.1 / Again\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan3.md; bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan3.md >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$? $(ls $FACTORY_STATE/tickets | tr '\n' ' ')")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 T-0001.1.yaml T-0001.2.yaml T-0001.yaml `

### Requirement: A spec that needs one sub-ticket becomes that sub-ticket without a planner run
`factory plan whole-spec <parent>`, on a parent at `ready-for-planner` with an approved spec, MUST act when four conditions hold: the parent has no sub-ticket; it has no earlier planner run; its latest spec-writer run did not end NEEDS-SPLIT; and its approved spec has no `##` or `###` heading, other than a requirement line, naming seams. It MUST then create one sub-ticket `<parent>.1`, ready for its implementer, whose text names every scenario of the approved spec. It MUST log `plan.skipped` with the reason, and report `"planner": "skipped"`. Otherwise it SHALL report `"planner": "needed"` with the reason and write nothing.

#### Scenario: A spec that needs one sub-ticket becomes that sub-ticket without a planner run
- GIVEN the fixture file written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

```sh

#### Scenario: A spec the writer split, or a parent a planner already ran on, still goes to the planner and nothing is written
Needs the GIVEN block of "A spec that needs one sub-ticket becomes that sub-ticket without a planner run" run once. The three cases are a NEEDS-SPLIT spec, a spec with a `### Size and seams` heading, and a parent with an earlier planner run.
- WHEN `(for c in 'NEEDS-SPLIT|' 'READY-FOR-CRITIC|### Size and seams' 'READY-FOR-CRITIC|planner-ran'; do (s=${c%%|*}; x=${c#*|}; [ "$x" = planner-ran ] && e='' || e=$x; . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-plan.sh $s "$e" && if [ "$x" = planner-ran ]; then P=$($B run start --role planner --ticket T-0001 | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'); $B run finish $P --status-override ESCALATE >/dev/null; fi; $B plan whole-spec T-0001 > $T/o 2>&1; echo "exit=$? planner=$(tail -1 $T/o | sed -n 's/.*"planner": "\([a-z]*\)".*/\1/p') subs=$(ls $T/store/tickets | tr '\n' ' ')logged=$($B log tail --event plan.skipped | grep -c .)"); done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `exit=0 planner=needed subs=T-0001.yaml logged=0`, three times

### Requirement: The whole-spec step refuses where a planner run would
`factory plan whole-spec` MUST refuse with exit 2, writing nothing, on a parent that is not at `ready-for-planner`, has a run in flight, or has no approved spec. A refusal for the wrong state SHALL name the state with `not ready-for-planner`.

#### Scenario: The whole-spec step refuses a parent that is not ready for its planner
Needs the GIVEN block of "A spec that needs one sub-ticket becomes that sub-ticket without a planner run" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-plan.sh READY-FOR-CRITIC '' && $B ticket transition T-0001 --to planned --by t >/dev/null && $B plan whole-spec T-0001 >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? named=$(grep -c 'not ready-for-planner' $T/err) subs=$(ls $T/store/tickets | tr '\n' ' ')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `exit=2 named=1 subs=T-0001.yaml `

## Decision log (decisions.md): standing decisions, read-only

2026-10-04 T-0023 `resolve --ruling F` also accepts a park whose reason starts with `BLOCKED`. It writes F as the next `approvals/<id>/ruling-<n>.md` and returns the sub-ticket to `ready-for-implementer` at the same round.
2026-10-04 T-0023 `resolve PARENT --replan F` moves a parked parent whose sub-tickets have all merged to `ready-for-planner`, with F as its next ruling. The planner receives F and plans the fix. Rejected: the requester's `--replan --file <plan>` straight to `planned`. It needs a new routing edge, which the queue policy does not count as small. It would also skip the planner. `dev/build-harness.spec.md` already sends a re-plan through the planner.
2026-10-04 T-0023 On a re-plan, the planner's input lists the parent's existing sub-tickets, each with its title and state. The human's note F therefore needs to say only what to fix. Rejected: asking the human to restate in F what has merged, which the store already knows.
2026-10-04 T-0023 Sub-tickets that a later plan adds take the next free ids under the parent, and their `Depends on:` lines may name the parent's existing sub-tickets. A plan head line that reuses an existing sub-ticket's id is refused. Rejected: honouring explicit non-colliding ids, a second numbering rule that the planner's free-form ids would make ambiguous.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A park reason is never blank. When the clerk relays an empty stderr, the workflows use the refusal's JSON `error`, and failing that `exit <n>, no JSON on stdout` or `exit <n>, no error text`. Rejected: editing each of the 26 reason sites.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A redispatch sets aside a checker's rows only when they did not pass. The reviewer's row is kept when it is `APPROVE`. The verifier and gate rows are kept together when they are `VERIFIED` and `PASS`, because one verifier run writes both. The build then runs only the checkers with no row on that commit. After an implementer run it still runs both. Rejected: a `--roles` flag on redispatch, which no reported case needs.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The store gets a `.gitattributes` holding `runs/** -whitespace`. `init` and every `run start` write it the way they already write `.gitignore`. Rejected: rewriting committed records, and excluding the store path inside each gate command.
2026-10-04 T-0023 `init` refuses, with exit 2 and nothing written, to create an instance while `FACTORY_STATE` names another store. A compose with no `context.md` refuses with exit 2. Rejected: writing every instance piece from a throwaway-store `init`. That contradicts the rule that such a run initialises only that store.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A relative `FACTORY_INSTANCE`, `FACTORY_STATE` or `FACTORY_REPO` resolves against the caller's directory: `FACTORY_CWD`, else the working directory.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The suite's own-store cases that are not about the uncommitted-edit refusal run the CLI through a test-only launcher that stubs that one check. The refusal itself keeps its tests on a clone's real `bin/factory`. Rejected: a switch the production CLI honours, which would loosen the check. Also rejected: running every case from a committed snapshot of the working tree, which changes every assertion that names this checkout's revision or paths.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The suite scenario gives pytest a fresh temporary directory under `/tmp` and removes it afterwards. Four existing tests need a temporary directory outside every repository, and an agent's scratch directory lies inside this one. The scenario states this in its command, so no role has to choose between its scratch rule and a valid run. Rejected: fixing those four tests in this ticket, which is beyond H8 and needs its own design (Out-of-scope observations).
2026-10-04 T-0023 The workflow-script fixes are checked by acceptance scenarios that run the scripts under node with a stub clerk. They get no suite test, because the suite does not need node today and adding that would change what the gate needs.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The change is built as four seams (design.md, "Size and seams"). They share one changelog entry, 51.
2026-10-04 T-0024 T-0024: instance B keeps the spec store created 2026-10-04 by run-0196; its tickets close by archive into current truth (operator)
2026-10-04 T-0024 While a role run is in flight on a live store, a human or runner writes it by prefixing that one command with FACTORY_DISPATCH=1; README documents it and the refusal text never names it (operator)
2026-10-04 T-0024 Instance B keeps the spec store that run-0196 created. Its tickets close by archive into current truth, and `decisions.md` keeps reaching the spec writer, critic and planner. The operator decided this in the first answer to this ticket, and it is already recorded in `decisions.md`. This is a standing decision. This ticket touches README, so it also corrects README's stale "never entered it" line, as that answer directs.
2026-10-04 T-0024 While a role run is in flight on a live store, the operator or a runner session writes it by putting `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` in front of that one command. README documents this. The refusal text never names the marker. The operator decided this in the same answer, and it is already recorded in `decisions.md`. This is a standing decision for every runner session, including the Driver session that runs the Nanobot fork's instance (instance A).
2026-10-04 T-0024 A write is refused, marker or not and run in flight or not, when the caller's directory lies under the own store's `runs/` or `worktrees/`. The operator's gate review asked for this rule. Rejected: applying it only while a run is in flight, because a process a role left running in its run directory would then write freely once the store went idle. Rejected: letting the marker lift it, because the rule exists so that a copied or exported marker does not help from there. This is a standing decision: the operator and runner sessions run store writes from outside the store.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The location rule is checked first, then the marker, then the in-flight list.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The in-flight rule acts only on an instance's own store, and only while at least one run is in flight on any ticket of that store. Rejected: refusing every unmarked write at all times, as the requester proposed. The operator would then need the marker on every command and would export it in the shell, and every role run started from that shell would inherit it. The operator's decision on the marker assumes unmarked writes when nothing is in flight.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The in-flight rule checks every ticket's in-flight list, not only the calling ticket's. The tool cannot tell which run, if any, is calling.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The marker is the environment variable `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1`. Both workflow scripts put it in front of every clerk command. Rejected: the requester's exemption for "a human's `--by`". Human commands have no `--by`, and `ticket transition` requires one from everyone.
2026-10-04 T-0024 A write is every command except a fixed read-only list: `ticket show`, `ticket join`, `results show`, `config`, `status parse`, `log tail` and `paths`. Any command given `--accept-harness` is a write, because it rewrites the lock and logs. A new command is fenced until someone adds it to the list. Rejected: the requester's list of ten write commands. It misses writes such as `ticket set`, `ticket park`, `ticket head`, `ticket ready-implementers`, `ticket parent-check`, `run compose` and `spec add`.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The refusal exits 2 and writes nothing. Its text is `role runs may not write the live store (<detail>); use a throwaway FACTORY_STATE`. The detail is `<store>; in flight: <run ids>` for the in-flight rule and `<store>; called from inside its runs/` (or `worktrees/`) for the location rule. The advice is meant for a role. The operator learns the marker from README.
2026-10-04 T-0024 A run left in flight by a dead workflow keeps the in-flight rule up. The operator clears it with a marked `run finish <run> --status-override KILLED`, run from the repository root, and README says so. Rejected: a timeout that drops the fence by itself. A long run that is still working would lose the fence.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The fence guards against accidents, not against a determined agent. It is not a security boundary. A role working from outside the store that copies the marker from the workflow scripts or README still gets through. That is recorded under Risk rather than designed around. Isolating role runs at the operating-system level is issue #37.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The fence is checked before the harness lock, the check that each instance runs only the harness revision it has accepted. A fenced command is refused before it reaches the lock, so a fenced `--accept-harness` rewrites nothing. A marked command still meets the lock and its uncommitted-edit refusal unchanged, so the marker cannot be used to get past the lock. Rejected: checking the fence after the lock, because `--accept-harness` rewrites the lock inside that check, so a fenced acceptance would write before it was refused.
2026-10-04 T-0024 Part B (a preamble line) is cut. The incident came from the test suite, not from a command the role typed, so a preamble line would not have stopped it. The refusal text gives the same advice at the moment it matters.
2026-10-04 T-0024 Part C (the tripwire on the store root) is cut. Role runs legitimately write their own run directory in the store (`output.md`, `scratch/`). Clerk commands for other tickets' runs also write the store during a run. A comparison of the store root therefore cannot tell whose write it saw. The fence refuses the write before it happens.
2026-10-04 T-0022 Removing clearly redundant work (a step, run or check that cannot change any outcome) is pre-approved, provided every refusal the pipeline gives today still fires (operator, 2026-10-04: 'slashing clearly redundant work is always going to be OK, if we trust our process')
2026-10-04 T-0022 Under a sub-ticket's Tests to change, the planner may list tests an earlier sibling of the same parent added, with a harness check that each first appeared in a sibling's merge; pre-existing tests still need the approved spec (operator, #40)
2026-10-04 T-0025 The store lives on its own branch, `factory-store`, checked out as a git worktree at the store's path (B1). This is for the operator to confirm at the spec gate. Rejected: B2, the branch written through git plumbing with no working copy. It needs new harness commands to snapshot, show and restore the store, and `git clean -fdx` in the integration checkout deletes the store (Evidence). Rejected: A, a gate exception (operator, 2026-10-04).
2026-10-04 T-0025 A store path must be one the integration branch has never tracked. Both existing stores move from `.factory/state` to `.factory/store`. Rejected: keeping `.factory/state`, where checking out an older commit overwrote an uncommitted record and checking `main` out again deleted it (Evidence).
2026-10-04 T-0025 The branch is named `factory-store`, and the design doc and build spec drop the name `tickets` for it. Rejected: `tickets`, a generic name in a target repo whose branches serve other work, such as the Nanobot repo, which shares its objects with another checkout.
2026-10-04 T-0025 `init` creates a new store as a worktree on an unborn `factory-store` branch, and the operator makes the first commit. On a clone where the branch already exists, `init` checks it out, which restores the store. Rejected: `init` committing, which needs a git identity, and the suite runs under a throwaway HOME that has none.
2026-10-04 T-0025 When no local `factory-store` exists and more than one remote carries it, `init` refuses and names each `<remote>/factory-store`. The operator picks one with `git branch factory-store <remote>/factory-store` and runs `init` again. Rejected: creating a new empty branch, which would silently start a second store history beside the pushed one. Also rejected: preferring `origin`, a guess about which remote is canonical.
2026-10-04 T-0025 With `FACTORY_INSTANCE` unset, `init` refuses, writing nothing, when the caller's git top level is a checkout of `factory-store`. It also refuses when the instance found by walking up from the caller's directory has a store that is that top level, or that contains it in the same repository (the same git common directory). These are the cases where it would build a phantom instance inside the live store. The second condition does not depend on which branch or commit the store has checked out, so a detached store HEAD does not open the route again (operator, round 2 change request N2). The same-repository qualifier keeps `init` working in a separate throwaway repository under a run's scratch directory (Evidence). Rejected: "contains" without that qualifier, which would refuse every suite `init` run with pytest's temporary directory inside a store. Rejected: taking the repository from the parent of `--git-common-dir`. That is the main worktree, which for the Nanobot instance is `~/dev/nanobot`, another checkout on another branch, and for the runtime checkout is `~/dev/spec-factory` (Evidence).
2026-10-04 T-0025 In `init`, every refusal and the store-worktree step come before any instance file is written, so a failed worktree step (for example, git's "already used by worktree" when `init` runs in a code checkout of a repo whose store branch is checked out elsewhere) leaves nothing behind.
2026-10-04 T-0025 The integration checkout ignores the store through the repo's git exclude file, which `init` and `store migrate` write. Rejected: a line in the target's tracked `.gitignore`. That would change the target's code to record a fact about one clone.
2026-10-04 T-0025 A new command, `factory store migrate --to PATH`, moves an existing store. It refuses unless the store is idle and committed, and it leaves the integration-branch side uncommitted for the operator to review. Rejected: a hand procedure, untested, run once on each repo by a different session.
2026-10-04 T-0025 `store migrate` deletes the old store directory only after it has checked that every ignored file (run scratch directories, tripwire baselines) was copied byte for byte. If the check fails, it undoes its own worktree and branch and leaves the old store as it was. Rejected: relying on `git status` in the new checkout, which cannot see ignored files.
2026-10-04 T-0025 The store branch starts with one commit whose tree is the store as last committed on the integration branch, and whose message names that commit. Earlier history stays readable with `git log <that commit> -- .factory/state`. Rejected: rewriting history with a subtree split. It would follow only part of the store's past, which began at `intake/state`, and it adds nothing that `main`'s history does not already keep.
2026-10-04 T-0025 An instance whose store is still a plain directory keeps working unchanged. `init` leaves such a store alone and points to `store migrate`. The harness reads and writes the store only through `state_dir`, so it runs with either layout.
2026-10-04 T-0022 A sub-ticket's "Tests to change" may list a test file that an earlier sibling of the same parent added, one line each: `` `<file>[::<test>]` (added by <sibling ID>): <reason> ``. The harness reads only lines of that form inside the "Tests to change" field, and checks the file, not the test function. Rejected: checking test functions. The implementer rule puts new tests in new files, so a file is what a sibling adds, and git records files.
2026-10-04 T-0022 A listed file counts as added by a sibling when it is absent at the parent's `parent_base`, and the first commit since then on the integration branch that added it lies inside one merged sibling's recorded merge (reachable from its `main_after`, not from its `base_before`). Any merged sibling of the parent counts, including those from an earlier plan. The sibling ID on the line is for the reader and is not matched. Rejected: matching the named ID, because the planner's IDs (`ST-1`) differ from the store's (`T-0001.1`) and the operator's rule names no particular sibling.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The check runs in `run start` for every implementer run of a sub-ticket: first dispatch, fix rounds and catch-up runs. Every dispatch passes through that one place. Rejected: checking when the plan is added, when no sibling has merged yet. Rejected: checking at the merge gate, after the implementer has already edited the test. Rejected: checking where a waiting sub-ticket is released, which happens in two places and never for a sub-ticket with no dependencies.
2026-10-04 T-0022 A failed check refuses the run start with exit 2, writes nothing, and gives an error that starts `BLOCKED from harness:` and names the file. The build workflow parks the sub-ticket with that error as the reason, so `resolve --ruling` handles it like an implementer's BLOCKED. That is what the operator's "parks for the operator, as today" describes. Rejected: a new kind of park with its own resolve verb. Rejected: having `run start` park the ticket itself, which would break the rule that a refusal writes nothing.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The preamble's guardrail sentence and the code reviewer's test-integrity check also accept a sibling entry that the harness has checked. Without them, the implementer and reviewer would still treat the edit as forbidden, and the park would remain.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The earlier sibling names the tests a later sibling will break under a new planner field, "Interim tests". The harness does not read it.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The critic's check for an omitted test goes under rubric 1 (Grounded), where the requester asked for it.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The requester's acceptance, a re-plan and re-spec of Nanobot T-0002 that the operator compares side by side, is an Operator step, not an acceptance scenario. Running it needs the Nanobot store and real agents, which a verifier must not touch.
2026-10-04 T-0032 Empty role output (#41, T-0032): labelled EMPTY-OUTPUT with the last message, re-dispatched once automatically, parked on a second; the code reviewer judges the diff and leaves the test suite and gates to the verifier.
2026-10-04 T-0029 Only the code reviewer lists declared protected paths, once for each head it reviews. The implementer and verifier may name them in their output, but not under ESCALATIONS. This is a standing decision: a later prompt change should not give another role a declared-path notice. The operator pre-approved it on 2026-10-04 (`.factory/answers/operator-decisions-2026-10-04.md`), under the standing decision that removing clearly redundant work is allowed when every refusal still fires.
2026-10-04 T-0029 A fix round makes a new head, so it gets its own reviewer notice, as today. Rejected: one notice per sub-ticket. A fix round can change a declared path again, and the operator would not hear about it.
2026-10-04 T-0029 The new rule also keeps one escalation for a declared path: when the change does something to it that the spec does not describe. An undeclared path still escalates as well. Rejected: the retro's wording "the reviewer lists declared paths for the merge gate". No local merge check reads the declaration, so that sentence would teach the roles something false.
2026-10-04 T-0029 The implementer and verifier get the same bullet word for word, as the last bullet under RULES. That way one text is checked in both prompts.
2026-10-04 T-0029 The changelog records the count re-derived from the store log (10 runs, 30 of 205 items). Rejected: the retro's 26 of 139, which its own table contradicts with 38.
2026-10-04 T-0029 Acceptance checks the composed run prompts and the document copies. The request's own check (on the next build, one notice per head, from the reviewer) is kept as an operator step. Rejected: an acceptance item that waits for a real build. The verifier cannot run one, and how a model follows a prompt rule is not something a check on one commit can prove.
2026-10-05 T-0028 Part A overturns the cut in T-0016's spec. The path-scoped gate skip is built as the operator pre-approved it, with no repository's configuration changed. Rejected: cutting it again because it would have skipped almost no past run. The request expects a small saving here and still asks for the mechanism. Part A is a separate part, so the operator can delete it and its scenarios at the gate.
2026-10-05 T-0028 A gate command's `paths` are git pathspecs. A command is skipped when `git diff --name-only <base>...<head> -- <paths>` lists no file. Include entries (`src/`) and exclude entries (`:(exclude)dev/`) both work. Rejected: a glob matcher of our own, a second matching rule that could disagree with git's. Standing: later tickets and instance configs use pathspec semantics.
2026-10-05 T-0028 If this repository's suite is ever scoped, its paths should exclude what it does not read rather than list what it does: `:(exclude)dev/` and `:(exclude)README.md`. Rejected: the requester's inclusion list, which leaves out `.gitignore` and any new top-level file, so it would skip the suite on changes that fail it.
2026-10-05 T-0028 The harness decides the skip when a reviewer or verifier run starts on a sub-ticket. It reads the live instance's configuration and that run's base and head. The verifier is told which commands are skipped, so it does not decide. Rejected: letting the verifier judge relevance, which no record could check.
2026-10-05 T-0028 Each skipped command is recorded twice: in the checker run's `meta.yaml` (`gate_skipped`) and on the `ci` row (`skipped`). Each entry has the command, `status: SKIPPED` and the reason. The row's PASS or FAIL still comes from the verifier's `Gate suite:` line, over the commands that ran.
2026-10-05 T-0028 A malformed gate entry refuses every implementer, reviewer and verifier run start with exit 2, before a run is created. A malformed entry is anything other than a string, or a mapping with a non-empty string `command` and an optional non-empty list of non-empty strings `paths`, with no other key. Rejected: treating a typo such as `path:` as unscoped. The operator would believe a scope is in force that is not.
2026-10-05 T-0028 An empty `paths` list is refused. Rejected: reading it as "covers nothing", which would skip the command on every diff.
2026-10-05 T-0028 The planner is skipped when all of these hold, and otherwise runs as today: the parent has no sub-ticket and no earlier planner run; its latest spec-writer run did not end NEEDS-SPLIT; and its approved spec has no `##` or `###` heading, other than a `### Requirement:` line, that contains the word seam or seams. This sorts all thirteen past parents as they were built (Evidence). Rejected: the requester's "exactly one lettered part", which would have skipped none of the nine. Rejected: NEEDS-SPLIT alone, which would have built T-0025's two parts, about 470 lines, as one sub-ticket. Standing: the planner runs only for a spec that is split, re-planned or already planned once.
2026-10-05 T-0028 To force the planner on a spec that meets every condition, the operator adds a `### Size and seams` heading in a gate edit (`approve-spec --edit`). No new flag.
2026-10-05 T-0028 The whole-spec sub-ticket is `<parent>.1`, at `ready-for-implementer`, with no dependency. Its text names every scenario of the approved spec, one `- <name>` line each. For everything else it points to the spec: every lettered part, the spec's labels, its Tests to change and its Risk list. Because it names every scenario, the parent closes on its VERIFIED run under the existing rule (part C).
2026-10-05 T-0028 The store records the skip three ways: a `plan.skipped` event in the log with its reason, the parent's plan file (`plans/<parent>.md`), and the change folder's `tasks.md` when the repository has a spec store. A planner-made plan writes the same two files.
2026-10-05 T-0028 A spec already applied on `main`, the planner's most frequent ESCALATE, is caught after the skip by the implementer's step 2 and by the verifier's base run of NEW checks (design part B, table). The catch costs an implementer run in place of a planner run. Rejected: a harness check of "already applied", which would need the agents' judgment of what the spec asks for.
2026-10-07 T-0032 Retry-once-then-park on a role's unusable output (#41's EMPTY-OUTPUT) is the general mechanism: later refusal kinds (#68 format, #67 spec-lint) register with it rather than adding their own. resolve --ruling should also accept a budget-kill or EMPTY-OUTPUT park (rulings had to be placed by hand on T-0029.1 and T-0028.1).
2026-10-07 T-0032 An empty output is `EMPTY-OUTPUT`, never a budget kill. That covers a missing or empty output file, an agent call that returns blank text, and one that returns `null` (a user skip or a terminal API error). Rejected: keeping a budget-kill path for some of these. The harness enforces no budget, and the agent call reports no reason (Evidence).
2026-10-07 T-0032 Standing, from the operator's answer, already in `decisions.md` as the 2026-10-04 T-0032 line, for both parts: the empty-output route, and the reviewer leaving the suite and the gate to the verifier. Later changes follow both.
2026-10-07 T-0032 `EMPTY-OUTPUT` is decided in one place, `run finish`. The workflows no longer send `--status-override KILLED` for an empty return, so `run finish` reads the output file for every run. Rejected: a second override value in the scripts. It would label a run empty even when its output file was written.
2026-10-07 T-0032 The retry is counted inside one workflow run: one re-dispatch, then a park. Rejected: a counter in the store. It would add a ticket field for a case that a human already watches, because a workflow that stops is restarted by hand.
2026-10-07 T-0032 A thrown agent call is not re-dispatched. It carries its own error text, including the error thrown when the turn's token ceiling is spent, so it is the one stop the harness can name.
2026-10-07 T-0032 The last message is kept by a new command, `factory run last-message RUN --text=…`, called only after `run finish` has returned `EMPTY-OUTPUT`. The text is the last 4000 characters, as one shell single-quoted word. Rejected: passing it on every `run finish`, which would put each role's whole output through every clerk command.
2026-10-07 T-0032 A second empty output parks as `EMPTY-OUTPUT from <role>`, in the same form as the other role parks, and lists both runs. The last messages stay in the run directories, not in the reason.
2026-10-07 T-0032 A checker's second empty output parks before any result row is recorded for it. `resolve --redispatch` then re-runs only that checker, because the other checker's passing rows stand. Rejected: an `EMPTY-OUTPUT` result row and a join rule for it, a new row status for the same outcome.
2026-10-07 T-0032 The reviewer's input no longer lists the gate commands. It says that the verifier runs them, as the design's routing table already declares (`docs/design.md:126`).
2026-10-07 T-0032 The `budget kill` join reason is kept for hand-recorded `KILLED` rows. Rejected: renaming it, which would change three existing tests for a case no one reported.
2026-10-07 T-0032 `build.js:137` (the implementer's `budget kill` park) is removed. `run finish` can no longer return `KILLED` to the workflow, so the line would never run.
2026-10-07 T-0033 Protected paths at merge (#57, T-0033): the pinned spec's Risk list is the authorization; an undeclared changed protected path is refused at merge and parks for a ruling; no per-head approval step. All instances.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The critic keeps its minimum check, at least 2 cited paths and 1 acceptance command per review. It gains a cap of at most 2 paths and 1 command for any one claim. Rejected: replacing the minimum with the cap, which would let a critic approve having checked nothing. `docs/principles.md`'s Spiking section states the bound per claim ("Grounding a claim … two paths, one command").
2026-10-08 T-0034 The critic runs no test suite and builds nothing (no clone, worktree or prototype of the change). It runs an acceptance command only as the spec gives it, and picks one that runs no test suite. Standing: a later change to the critic prompt keeps this rule, as principle 2 requires.
2026-10-08 T-0034 A claim the critic could settle only by running a test suite or building the change is a finding for the writer, or a question, and the critic says what it could not check. The finding's severity follows the existing rubric. Rubric item 2 ("NEW items fail today") stays unchanged.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The writer and the critic get the same three reading sentences: batch independent reads and commands, read a line range once grep has found it, and send long output to a scratch file and grep or tail it. Only the writer gets "write the spec in as few writes as you can". The critic writes one verdict and needs no such rule.
2026-10-08 T-0034 No shared preamble line. The rules go only in the two role prompts. Rejected: a preamble line, which would reach every role, including the implementer and verifier, which the request does not cover.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The rules are added as new lines only, so no existing line of either prompt changes. The writer's rule is the last RULES bullet of the documented copy. The critic's rules follow its existing PROCESS line.
2026-10-08 T-0034 `docs/principles.md` records the critic's new rule under principle 2 and corrects principle 2's status line, which says "reader roles run no suites" was done by #41 alone.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The request's acceptance, a replay of 2–3 approved intakes with old and new prompts, is an Operator step. Running it needs live model runs, and judging spec quality side by side is a human call. The scenarios check the text the roles receive.
