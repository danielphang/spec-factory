## Context for this run (composed by the harness, not part of the request)

Repository: `spec-factory`, the design repo at `~/dev/spec-factory` (branch `main`). It holds the
design and the harness that runs it:
- `docs/design.md`, the design document and the source of truth, with its changelog in
  `docs/changelog.md`;
- `docs/prompts/`, each file a verbatim copy of one prompt block in the design doc; it changes only
  by re-copying that block;
- `dev/`, the working documents for building the factory itself: `dev/build-harness.spec.md` (the
  spec for building the harness), `dev/build-harness.plan.md` (the Planner's decomposition of it),
  `dev/P0-intake-skeleton.md` (the walking skeleton) and `dev/issues.md` (this repo's issue index);
- the harness, as code in this repo: `factory/` (the package, its role prompts and its workflow
  scripts), `bin/factory` (the entry point), `agents/` (the agent definition templates) and
  `tests/factory/` (its suite). Install with `uv sync --frozen`; test with
  `uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory`;
- `.factory/`, this repo's own instance of the factory: `instance.yaml`, this briefing,
  `harness.lock`, closed records (`answers/`, `green-pilot/`) and the live store, `store/`.
  The store is a checkout of its own branch, `factory-store`; the operator commits it there, so a
  store commit never moves `main`.

Two checkouts. Tickets are built and merged in the dev checkout, `~/dev/spec-factory` on `main`.
The factory runs from the runtime checkout, `~/dev/spec-factory-harness`, a detached worktree of
this repo at the harness revision `.factory/harness.lock` has accepted. A merge into `main` never
changes the running code; only the upgrade step moves the runtime, after which the instance
refuses its store until `--accept-harness`. Your shell may start in another directory: use
absolute paths, or `cd ~/dev/spec-factory && <cmd>`.

The Nanobot fork at `~/dev/nanobot-upstream` (branch `feat/lionbot-v3.5`) is instance A: a target
with only `.factory/`, run from the same runtime by its own Driver session. This repo's harness was
imported from its retired `feat/lionbot-v3` branch. Read it only to observe what a fix does there; never write there, and never copy its test names,
line numbers or commit SHAs into a spec. Never read or write `~/.nanobot/` (live credentials).

Acceptance commands must be runnable as written from `~/dev/spec-factory` (grep, sed, diff,
`git diff --check` against the documents, the harness suite). A change to the design doc keeps its
own conventions: its changelog entry in `docs/changelog.md`, `dev/build-harness.spec.md`
consistent with the new text, and any `docs/prompts/` file whose block changed re-copied from it.

The request is an issue draft, written from a real pipeline run: where in the documents,
what happened (the evidence), why it matters, a proposed fix, and the Nanobot-side commit
where a harness fix already exists. The evidence is the requirement; the proposed fix is the
requester's suggestion, not a requirement. Verify the as-built fix in the reference harness
before relying on it; a NEW criterion that already passes on this checkout proves nothing.

Output: write your complete output, in your role's required format and ending with the
STATUS / CONFIDENCE / ESCALATIONS trailer, to the file named under "Output file" below. For
every role but the implementer that is the only file you may create or modify. The implementer
also changes files in its own worktree and commits there, and nowhere else. Then return the same
text as your final message.

This repo's current-state page is the top-level `README.md`. A change to a command, state, stop or
path updates it in the same ticket; read its "Maintaining this page" section before editing it.

Who reads what the roles write here: the operator at the spec gate, and a technical reader new to this project reading the README or a PR description. Gloss every term specific to the factory at first use (docs/writing.md).
## Output file
`/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/runs/run-0364-triage/output.md`

## Running code
Run every test, script or prototype through this wrapper, which gives it a fresh temporary HOME so it cannot write the operator's real home directory: `(export HOME="$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P)"; <command>)`. Put your command in place of <command>. This includes every test or check command the briefing above gives. A throwaway HOME does not stop a write to an absolute path: never run anything that could write a protected path outside the repository.

## Scratch directory
Put every file you make for your own use in this run under `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/runs/run-0364-triage/scratch`: no other run uses it. The harness clears it when the ticket moves on, and keeps it while the ticket is parked.

## Request (raw, with any answers appended)

---
title: "Reading rules for the implementer, verifier, code reviewer, planner and triage (#76, the part #73 did not cover)"
labels: "harness"
---
**Where:** `factory/prompts/implementer.md`, `verifier.md`, `reviewer.md`, `planner.md`, `triage.md`, with their design-doc blocks and `docs/prompts/` copies.

**Problem:** #73 gave the spec writer and critic three reading rules: batch independent reads and commands, read a line range once grep has found it, and send long command output to the scratch directory and grep or tail it. On the replay, the spec writer's tokens fell about 37% with spec quality held (changelog 58). The other roles have no such rules. The implementer is 18% and the verifier 13% of all workflow context tokens (2026-10-05, 866M total).

**Proposed change (prompt-only):**
- A. The same reading paragraph as #73's, in the five other role prompts and their copies. The spec writer's extra "write in as few writes as you can" is not included.
- B. Nothing else changes: no rubric, routing, round limit or required section moves. The enforcing hook stays with #65 (#76 part B).

**Acceptance:** the copies stay in step and carry the paragraph. As a prompt change, the build is followed by the operator's replay: two or three past build runs (implementer and verifier) with old and new prompts, the same inputs and bases, comparing calls, tokens and verdict quality. The runtime moves only after the operator accepts.

Operator's go 2026-10-09; part of #76 (https://github.com/danielphang/spec-factory/issues/76).

## Capability index: every capability in current truth

Name the capabilities this request touches on your `Capabilities:` line. The spec writer receives those in full and this index for the rest.

- build-dispatch, 31 kB, `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/openspec/specs/build-dispatch/spec.md`: A park reason carries the failing command's error; The build runs only the checkers a commit still needs; The workflows' clerk commands carry the dispatcher marker; An implementer starts only when each sibling-added test it may change came from a merged sibling; The build parks a harness-blocked sub-ticket as BLOCKED, so a ruling returns it; The build asks the whole-spec step before it runs the planner; A role run that leaves no output is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT; A role run that writes its output runs once and routes on its STATUS; The build counts only the current plan's sub-tickets; A parent's final check and close count only the current plan's sub-tickets; The build parks a merge the gate blocked, with the gate's reason
- gate-commands, 9 kB, `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/openspec/specs/gate-commands/spec.md`: A gate command may declare its paths and is skipped for a sub-ticket that touches none of them; A skipped command is recorded on the gate result, and the merge still needs that result to pass; The implementer is given every gate command; A malformed gate entry refuses every build role's run start

- harness-suite, 2 kB, `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/openspec/specs/harness-suite/spec.md`: The harness suite runs mid-edit without loosening the lock
- human-resolution, 18 kB, `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/openspec/specs/human-resolution/spec.md`: A ruling returns a BLOCKED sub-ticket to its implementer; Existing ruling routes are unchanged; A re-plan returns a fully merged parent to its planner; A redispatch sets aside only rows that did not pass; Accepting the refused paths returns the sub-ticket to its checks, which then merge; A ruling on a merge gate's refusal sends the sub-ticket back to its implementer; A ruling on a reviewer's escalation returns the sub-ticket to its checks
- live-store-guard, 13 kB, `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/openspec/specs/live-store-guard/spec.md`: Unmarked writes to a live store are refused while a role run is in flight there; Writes from inside a store's run directories or code checkouts are refused, marked or not; Reads, marked commands from outside the store, throwaway stores and idle stores stay open; The marker does not lift the harness lock
- merge-gate, 9 kB, `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/openspec/specs/merge-gate/spec.md`: A store commit does not hold back a merge; A commit to the integration branch still holds back a merge; The merge gate refuses a changed protected path the pinned spec does not declare; A declared or unprotected path merges with no further approval
- role-escalations, 5 kB, `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/openspec/specs/role-escalations/spec.md`: The implementer and verifier leave declared protected paths out of ESCALATIONS; Every role still escalates an undeclared protected path, and the code reviewer still lists declared ones
- role-inputs, 12 kB, `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/openspec/specs/role-inputs/spec.md`: The spec writer and critic receive in full only the capabilities their ticket names or their spec cites, and a capability index for the rest; A ticket whose triage output names no capabilities receives today's inputs; Triage receives the capability index and is asked to name the capabilities a request touches; The spec writer, critic and planner receive the whole decision log, whatever capabilities their ticket names
- store-setup, 19 kB, `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/openspec/specs/store-setup/spec.md`: Run records are exempt from whitespace checks; No half instance, and a missing briefing refuses; Relative environment paths resolve from the caller's directory; A new instance's store is a checkout of its own branch; init refuses when more than one remote carries the store branch; init refuses to run from inside the store checkout; init refuses a store path the integration branch has tracked; store migrate moves a tracked store onto its branch and keeps every record; store migrate refuses while the store is in use or uncommitted; A checkout of an older commit leaves a moved store untouched
- sub-ticket-planning, 16 kB, `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/openspec/specs/sub-ticket-planning/spec.md`: A later plan's sub-tickets continue the parent's numbering; A spec that needs one sub-ticket becomes that sub-ticket without a planner run; The whole-spec step refuses where a planner run would; A plan made from a later approved version supersedes the earlier plan's unmerged sub-tickets; A new plan may not depend on a sub-ticket it supersedes; The planner is told which sub-tickets its plan will supersede
