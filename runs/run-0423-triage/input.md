## Context for this run (composed by the harness, not part of the request)

Repository: `spec-factory`, the design repo at `~/dev/spec-factory` (branch `main`). It holds the
design and the harness that runs it:
- `docs/design.md`, the design document and the source of truth, with its changelog in
  `docs/changelog.md`;
- `docs/prompts/`, each file a verbatim copy of one prompt block in the design doc; it changes only
  by re-copying that block;
- `dev/`, the working documents for building the factory itself: `dev/build-harness.spec.md` (the
  spec for building the harness), `dev/build-harness.plan.md` (the Planner's decomposition of it),
  `dev/P0-intake-skeleton.md` (the walking skeleton) and `dev/issues.md` (this repo's issue index);
- the harness, as code in this repo: `factory/` (the package, its role prompts and its workflow
  scripts), `bin/factory` (the entry point), `agents/` (the agent definition templates) and
  `tests/factory/` (its suite). Install with `uv sync --frozen`; test with
  `uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory`;
- `.factory/`, this repo's own instance of the factory: `instance.yaml`, this briefing,
  `harness.lock`, closed records (`answers/`, `green-pilot/`) and the live store, `store/`.
  The store is a checkout of its own branch, `factory-store`; the operator commits it there, so a
  store commit never moves `main`.

Two checkouts. Tickets are built and merged in the dev checkout, `~/dev/spec-factory` on `main`.
The factory runs from the runtime checkout, `~/dev/spec-factory-harness`, a detached worktree of
this repo at the harness revision `.factory/harness.lock` has accepted. A merge into `main` never
changes the running code; only the upgrade step moves the runtime, after which the instance
refuses its store until `--accept-harness`. Your shell may start in another directory: use
absolute paths, or `cd ~/dev/spec-factory && <cmd>`.

The Nanobot fork at `~/dev/nanobot-upstream` (branch `feat/lionbot-v3.5`) is instance A: a target
with only `.factory/`, run from the same runtime by its own Driver session. This repo's harness was
imported from its retired `feat/lionbot-v3` branch. Read it only to observe what a fix does there; never write there, and never copy its test names,
line numbers or commit SHAs into a spec. Never read or write `~/.nanobot/` (live credentials).

Acceptance commands must be runnable as written from `~/dev/spec-factory` (grep, sed, diff,
`git diff --check` against the documents, the harness suite). A change to the design doc keeps its
own conventions: its changelog entry in `docs/changelog.md`, `dev/build-harness.spec.md`
consistent with the new text, and any `docs/prompts/` file whose block changed re-copied from it.

The request is an issue draft, written from a real pipeline run: where in the documents,
what happened (the evidence), why it matters, a proposed fix, and the Nanobot-side commit
where a harness fix already exists. The evidence is the requirement; the proposed fix is the
requester's suggestion, not a requirement. Verify the as-built fix in the reference harness
before relying on it; a NEW criterion that already passes on this checkout proves nothing.

Output: write your complete output, in your role's required format and ending with the
STATUS / CONFIDENCE / ESCALATIONS trailer, to the file named under "Output file" below. For
every role but the implementer that is the only file you may create or modify. The implementer
also changes files in its own worktree and commits there, and nowhere else. Then return the same
text as your final message.

This repo's current-state page is the top-level `README.md`. A change to a command, state, stop or
path updates it in the same ticket; read its "Maintaining this page" section before editing it.

Who reads what the roles write here: the operator at the spec gate, and a technical reader new to this project reading the README or a PR description. Gloss every term specific to the factory at first use (docs/writing.md).
## Output file
`/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/runs/run-0423-triage/output.md`

## Running code
Run every test, script or prototype through this wrapper, which gives it a fresh temporary HOME so it cannot write the operator's real home directory: `([ -z "${VIRTUAL_ENV:-}" ] || PATH=$(printf %s "$PATH" | tr : '\n' | grep -vxF "$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin" | paste -sd: -); unset VIRTUAL_ENV PYTHONHOME; export HOME="$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P)"; <command>)`. Put your command in place of <command>. This includes every test or check command the briefing above gives. A throwaway HOME does not stop a write to an absolute path: never run anything that could write a protected path outside the repository.

## Scratch directory
Put every file you make for your own use in this run under `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/runs/run-0423-triage/scratch`: no other run uses it. The harness clears it when the ticket moves on, and keeps it while the ticket is parked.

## Request (raw, with any answers appended)

---
title: "factory drive: a second drive is refused while any other ticket has a run in flight"
---

Found by the Driver on Nanobot, 2026-10-10, at harness `4bfedc7` (runtime `66bd872`).

## What happened

- 20:33Z: `factory drive T-0036 --phase intake` and `factory drive T-0035 --phase build --parallel 1` started together, and both ran (run-0417 triage, run-0418 implementer).
- The T-0036 drive was stopped with SIGTERM while its spec writer was running (run-0419 recorded KILLED, as designed).
- Re-running `factory drive T-0036 --phase intake` was refused: `role runs may not write the live store (.../.factory/store; in flight: run-0418-implementer); use a throwaway FACTORY_STATE`.

So a second drive on a different ticket starts only if no run is in flight anywhere in the store. That breaks "workflows on different tickets may run in parallel".

## Cause

`main()` in `factory/cli.py` applies `fence()` to every command not in `READ_ONLY`, including `drive`. `drive()` sets `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` only after that check passed. The drive is the dispatcher, so the in-flight part of the fence should not apply to it.

The fence also happens to be the only thing that stops two drives on the same ticket. `drive.py` has no same-ticket guard of its own.

## Fix

- `drive` skips the fence's in-flight check. It keeps the check for a caller inside `runs/` or `worktrees/`, so a role still cannot start a drive.
- Add a same-ticket guard: `drive T` refuses when T or any of its sub-tickets has a run in flight, or when `drive/T.yaml` names a live pid with no `ended`.
- Suite cases:
  - a drive on T2 starts while T1 has a run in flight;
  - a drive on T1 is refused while T1 or a T1 sub-ticket has a run in flight;
  - a drive started from inside `runs/` is refused.

Workaround until then: prefix `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` on a drive for a ticket with no run in flight, never on the same ticket.

## Capability index: every capability in current truth

Name the capabilities this request touches on your `Capabilities:` line. The spec writer receives those in full and this index for the rest.
