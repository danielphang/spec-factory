## Context for this run (composed by the harness, not part of the request)

Repository: `spec-factory`, the design repo at `~/dev/spec-factory` (branch `main`). It holds the
design and the harness that runs it:
- `docs/design.md`, the design document and the source of truth, with its changelog in
  `docs/changelog.md`;
- `docs/prompts/`, each file a verbatim copy of one prompt block in the design doc; it changes only
  by re-copying that block;
- `dev/`, the working documents for building the factory itself: `dev/build-harness.spec.md` (the
  spec for building the harness), `dev/build-harness.plan.md` (the Planner's decomposition of it),
  `dev/P0-intake-skeleton.md` (the walking skeleton) and `dev/issues.md` (this repo's issue index);
- the harness, as code in this repo: `factory/` (the package, its role prompts and its workflow
  scripts), `bin/factory` (the entry point), `agents/` (the agent definition templates) and
  `tests/factory/` (its suite). Install with `uv sync --frozen`; test with
  `uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory`;
- `.factory/`, this repo's own instance of the factory: `instance.yaml`, this briefing,
  `harness.lock`, closed records (`answers/`, `green-pilot/`) and the live store, `store/`.
  The store is a checkout of its own branch, `factory-store`; the operator commits it there, so a
  store commit never moves `main`.

Two checkouts. Tickets are built and merged in the dev checkout, `~/dev/spec-factory` on `main`.
The factory runs from the runtime checkout, `~/dev/spec-factory-harness`, a detached worktree of
this repo at the harness revision `.factory/harness.lock` has accepted. A merge into `main` never
changes the running code; only the upgrade step moves the runtime, after which the instance
refuses its store until `--accept-harness`. Your shell may start in another directory: use
absolute paths, or `cd ~/dev/spec-factory && <cmd>`.

The Nanobot fork at `~/dev/nanobot-upstream` (branch `feat/lionbot-v3.5`) is instance A: a target
with only `.factory/`, run from the same runtime by its own Driver session. This repo's harness was
imported from its retired `feat/lionbot-v3` branch. Read it only to observe what a fix does there; never write there, and never copy its test names,
line numbers or commit SHAs into a spec. Never read or write `~/.nanobot/` (live credentials).

Acceptance commands must be runnable as written from `~/dev/spec-factory` (grep, sed, diff,
`git diff --check` against the documents, the harness suite). A change to the design doc keeps its
own conventions: its changelog entry in `docs/changelog.md`, `dev/build-harness.spec.md`
consistent with the new text, and any `docs/prompts/` file whose block changed re-copied from it.

The request is an issue draft, written from a real pipeline run: where in the documents,
what happened (the evidence), why it matters, a proposed fix, and the Nanobot-side commit
where a harness fix already exists. The evidence is the requirement; the proposed fix is the
requester's suggestion, not a requirement. Verify the as-built fix in the reference harness
before relying on it; a NEW criterion that already passes on this checkout proves nothing.

Output: write your complete output, in your role's required format and ending with the
STATUS / CONFIDENCE / ESCALATIONS trailer, to the file named under "Output file" below. For
every role but the implementer that is the only file you may create or modify. The implementer
also changes files in its own worktree and commits there, and nowhere else. Then return the same
text as your final message.

This repo's current-state page is the top-level `README.md`. A change to a command, state, stop or
path updates it in the same ticket; read its "Maintaining this page" section before editing it.

Who reads what the roles write here: the operator at the spec gate, and a technical reader new to this project reading the README or a PR description. Gloss every term specific to the factory at first use (docs/writing.md).
## Output file
`/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/runs/run-0354-critic/output.md`

## Running code
Run every test, script or prototype through this wrapper, which gives it a fresh temporary HOME so it cannot write the operator's real home directory: `(export HOME="$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P)"; <command>)`. Put your command in place of <command>. This includes every test or check command the briefing above gives. A throwaway HOME does not stop a write to an absolute path: never run anything that could write a protected path outside the repository.

## Scratch directory
Put every file you make for your own use in this run under `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/runs/run-0354-critic/scratch`: no other run uses it. The harness clears it when the ticket moves on, and keeps it while the ticket is parked.

## Spec under review (v2)

=== proposal.md
## Problem

When the operator, the person who runs the factory and approves its work, sends an already-planned ticket back for a new spec, the ticket's build stops for good on work left over from the old plan. The operator can get past it only by hand-editing the files where the factory keeps each ticket's state. It happened on 2026-10-08 to ticket T-0024 on Nanobot, one of the repositories the factory builds in, and that ticket now runs on a hand-made workaround.

Some terms first. The factory builds a ticket from a spec the operator approves at the spec gate, the one point where a human signs off a design before code is written. Each approval is numbered: approved spec v1, v2 and so on. The planner, an agent, splits the approved spec into sub-tickets. Each sub-ticket is one piece of the work, built on its own branch and merged on its own; together they make up the plan. The build loop dispatches each sub-ticket that is ready. When every sub-ticket has merged, one final check runs the whole spec against the merged result and then closes the parent ticket. To park a ticket is to stop it and hand it to the operator with a reason.

The design already provides for a change of plan (`docs/design.md:109`). The operator may send a planned ticket back, approve a new spec version and have the planner split it again. The new sub-tickets take the next free numbers under the same parent. But the old plan's sub-tickets stay attached, and the build still counts all of them:

- An old sub-ticket the operator closed parks the parent at once, with "sub-ticket closed by a human". No command resumes the build from that park. The re-plan command refuses too, because it needs every sub-ticket merged.
- An old sub-ticket that never started is still treated as current work. The build would dispatch it against the new spec, and the parent cannot close until it merges.
- The final check and the close refuse while any old sub-ticket is unmerged.

The people affected are the operator, who must hand-edit ticket state files to get past the park, and any ticket whose spec changes after planning. Ticket T-0027 (issue #44), approved but not yet built, adds a command that amends an approved spec after planning, which leads into the same situation.

The fix records on each sub-ticket the approved version it was planned from. When a newer plan exists, an old sub-ticket that never merged is superseded: it is kept with its id and record, but it no longer dispatches, parks the parent or holds back the close. Old sub-tickets that merged stay merged and count as done work. "Superseded" is used in the same sense as the check results a re-check already sets aside: an earlier record that is kept but no longer counted.

## Evidence

On Nanobot, read-only (`~/dev/nanobot-upstream/.factory/store/log/2026-10.jsonl`):
- Line 1392: T-0024.1 created from the plan of approved v2. Line 1396: closed by hand. Lines 1397-1398: the parent was parked and sent to the spec gate.
- Lines 1730-1732: the parent was approved at v4. Line 1751: the new planner run created T-0024.2.
- Line 1753: `"event": "ticket.parked", "ticket": "T-0024", "from": "planned", "reason": "sub-ticket closed by a human: T-0024.1"`.
- Lines 1780-1781: the hand-made workaround. The record `tickets/T-0024.1.yaml` was moved to `tickets/superseded/`, and the parent was set back to `planned`. It works only because the sub-ticket lookup does not read subdirectories.
- Every sub-ticket record on both stores carries `spec.approved_version`, the version it was created with. Within each parent all share one version, except Nanobot T-0024 (T-0024.1 at v2, T-0024.2 at v4).

Reproduced on this checkout (`main` at `51e2af7`). The fixture `t0038-respec.sh` (GIVEN block in the first scenario below) plans T-0001 at v1 as T-0001.1 (merged), T-0001.2 (closed by hand) and T-0001.3 (never started). It then sends the parent back and approves v2. A second plan adds T-0001.4, which depends on the merged T-0001.1:

| Command (after the re-plan) | Output today |
|---|---|
| `ticket ready-implementers T-0001` | `"ready": ["T-0001.4"]`, `"closed": ["T-0001.2"]`, no `superseded` list |
| `build.js` on T-0001, real store commands | `park T-0001: sub-ticket closed by a human: T-0001.2` |
| `ticket parent-check T-0001` with T-0001.4 merged | `"state": "planned"`, so the final check never starts |
| `ticket transition T-0001 --to closed` after a VERIFIED final check | exit 2, `T-0001 has sub-tickets: it closes after a VERIFIED parent-close run` |
| `resolve T-0001 --replan F` after a failed final check | exit 2, `--replan needs every sub-ticket merged: T-0001.2 is closed, T-0001.3 is waiting-dependencies` |
| `subticket add` of a plan whose `Depends on:` names T-0001.3 | exit 0: T-0001.4 is created waiting on a sub-ticket that should not be built |

A prototype of the change below, in a scratch clone, printed each NEW scenario's expected output. On that prototype the harness suite gave `384 passed in 198.34s`.

## Root cause

- `factory/store.py:228-235` `subtickets_of` globs `tickets/<parent>.*.yaml` and returns every match. No record says which plan a sub-ticket belongs to.
- `factory/cli.py:549-566` `ticket_ready_implementers` builds `ready`, `remaining` and `closed` from every sub-ticket. `factory/workflows/build.js:264` parks the parent whenever `closed` is non-empty.
- `factory/cli.py:738-751` `ticket_parent_check` needs every sub-ticket merged.
- `factory/cli.py:1335-1341` `_parent_close_verified` needs every sub-ticket merged. It guards `ticket transition --to closed` (`cli.py:161-167`) and `archive` (`cli.py:1365`). `_reused_subticket_run` (`cli.py:1302-1306`) counts every sub-ticket.
- `factory/cli.py:912-917`, `resolve --replan`, refuses unless every sub-ticket merged.
- `factory/cli.py:478`: a sub-ticket's `spec` record is the only trace of its plan. Approved T-0027 (its spec v2, Decisions line 66) moves that record forward on every unmerged, unclosed sub-ticket when a spec is amended. After T-0027 it no longer shows which plan a sub-ticket came from.

## Out of scope

- `factory/workflows/build.js` and every other workflow script: unchanged. They read the lists the store commands return.
- No new state or routing edge. In particular there is no `parked` → `planned` edge.
- A superseded sub-ticket's status, branch and record are never changed or moved by the harness.
- A run or merge a human starts by hand on a superseded sub-ticket is not refused.
- `merge`'s release of waiting siblings (`cli.py:680-688`) and its sibling-tests check (`cli.py:255`), which reads only merged sub-tickets: unchanged.
- The whole-spec step's planner decision (`_planner_needed`, `cli.py:492-495`) still counts every sub-ticket. A re-specced parent therefore always gets a planner run, and the one-sub-ticket path never recreates `<parent>.1`.
- The planner input's per-sub-ticket lines (`- <id> / <title>: <state>`): unchanged.
- T-0027's `spec amend` command.
- The Nanobot store, which holds the hand-made workaround (Operator steps).

## Open questions

none

## Decisions

- Each sub-ticket records `planned_from`, the parent's approved version when the sub-ticket was created. Nothing changes it afterwards. Rejected: reading `spec.approved_version`, which approved T-0027 moves forward on amendment.
- Superseded is computed whenever sub-tickets are read, not stored. A sub-ticket is superseded when it has not merged and its `planned_from` is lower than the highest `planned_from` among its parent's sub-tickets. Rejected: the request's mark written at re-plan time. That needs a write on every path that adds a plan and a migration for stores that already hold such sub-tickets, such as Nanobot T-0024. Also rejected: comparing with the parent's current approved version. That would supersede the live plan after a T-0027 amendment that keeps it.
- A record without `planned_from`, or with it null, falls back to its `spec.approved_version`. With neither, the sub-ticket counts as current.
- A plan made from the same approved version supersedes nothing. This covers `resolve --replan` after a failed final check, and a second plan added by hand. The design ties a new plan to an amended spec (`docs/design.md:109`). To replace a plan without changing intent, the operator approves with `approve-spec --edit`, which always makes a new version. This is a standing decision.
- Merged sub-tickets are never superseded. They count toward the close, the final check must contain their merges, and a new plan may depend on them.
- `subticket add` refuses, writing nothing, a plan whose `Depends on:` names a sub-ticket that the plan supersedes. Rejected: accepting it. The dependant would wait forever, because a superseded sub-ticket is never dispatched.
- `subticket add` reports the sub-ticket ids it newly supersedes under `superseded` and logs a `subtickets.superseded` event. Nothing is deleted, and every id stays taken.
- `ticket ready-implementers` keeps `subtickets` as every sub-ticket id. `build.js` reads an empty list as "planned with none", and `dev/build-harness.spec.md:286` documents it that way. Every other list there leaves superseded sub-tickets out, and the new `superseded` list names them.
- The planner is told which sub-tickets its plan will supersede, on one line after the existing list. With none, its input is byte-identical to today.
- The name is "superseded", as the request and triage use it, and in the same sense as `results/<head>/superseded-<n>/`: a record kept but no longer counted.

## Risk

Blast radius: every parent with sub-tickets, through `ready-implementers`, `parent-check`, the close and archive guards, `resolve --replan`, `subticket add` and the planner's input. On a parent whose sub-tickets were all planned from one approved version, the split marks nothing superseded and nothing changes. That is every parent on both stores today, counting Nanobot T-0024 as it stands after the hand-made workaround. On a parent re-planned from a newer version, its unmerged older sub-tickets stop counting. That is the intended change.

Protected paths touched: harness, `factory/**`: `factory/cli.py`, `factory/subtickets.py`, `factory/compose.py`. No file under `factory/workflows/`, `factory/prompts/`, `docs/prompts/`, `agents/`, `bin/factory`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock` or `.factory/` changes.

The change reaches a target only after the runtime is moved to a revision that contains it and the instance accepts that harness.

Sequencing with T-0027 (#44): build this first, as the request asks. If T-0027 merges first, it moves the `spec` record on any sub-ticket created before this change, still unmerged and still open. The fallback above would then read that moved version for those records.

## Operator steps

Optional. Once Nanobot runs a harness revision that contains this change (the operator moves it there with `--accept-harness`), the hand-made workaround can be undone. On `factory-store`, the branch that holds Nanobot's ticket state, run `git mv tickets/superseded/T-0024.1.yaml tickets/` and commit. Then `factory ticket ready-implementers T-0024` should list `T-0024.1` under `superseded` and not under `closed`: the old sub-ticket is kept but no longer counted. Leaving the workaround in place also works, because the sub-ticket lookup never reads that subdirectory.

=== design.md
## Proposed change

A. Record the plan (`factory/cli.py` `_create_subtickets`, lines 471-484). Beside `st["spec"]`, set `st["planned_from"] = parent["spec"]["approved_version"]`. Both `subticket add` and `plan whole-spec` create sub-tickets here. Nothing else writes the field.

B. One rule, in `factory/subtickets.py` (pure functions, next to `ready_implementers`):
- `planned_from(sub)` returns the record's `planned_from` when present and not null. Otherwise it returns `spec.approved_version`, and otherwise None.
- `split_plan(subs) -> (current, superseded)` keeps the input order. A sub-ticket is superseded when its status is not `merged`, its `planned_from` is not None, and that value is lower than the highest non-None `planned_from` in `subs`. All others are current.

C. Count only the current plan (`factory/cli.py`):
- `ticket_ready_implementers` (549-566) computes `ready`, the waiting-sibling release, `remaining`, `in_flight`, `parked`, `resumable` and `closed` from the current sub-tickets only. It keeps `subtickets` as every id and adds `"superseded": [ids]`.
- `ticket_parent_check` (738-751) keeps refusing a parent with no sub-tickets at all. It applies the all-merged test and builds its `subtickets` map from the current sub-tickets, and it adds `"superseded": [ids]`.
- `_reused_subticket_run` (1302-1306) and `_parent_close_verified` (1335-1341) use the current sub-tickets. This covers `ticket transition --to closed`, `archive` and parent-check's `reuse`. The guards' "has any sub-tickets" tests (161, 1365) stay on every sub-ticket.
- `resolve --replan` (912-917) applies its "every sub-ticket merged" test to the current sub-tickets.

D. Re-planning (`subticket_add`, 438-468). Before writing anything:
- Compute `after`, the ids `split_plan` would mark superseded once sub-tickets planned from the parent's current `approved_version` are added. Compute `before`, the ids it marks superseded now.
- A `Depends on:` that names an id in `after` is refused with exit 2 and nothing written. The error is `<id> (<label>) depends on <dep>, which this plan supersedes`.

After creating, when `after - before` is non-empty, log `subtickets.superseded` with `ticket=<parent>`, `subtickets=[ids in id order]` and `approved_version=<n>`. The JSON output gains `"superseded": [those ids]`, which is `[]` when there are none.

E. Planner input (`factory/compose.py` 318-322). After the existing `## Sub-tickets already under <id>` list, when D's `after` set for the parent is non-empty, append the line `Not merged and planned from an earlier approved version, so a new plan supersedes them and may not depend on them: <ids joined by ", ">`, preceded by a blank line. With none, the section stays byte-identical. `tests/factory/test_replan.py:108` pins it.

F. Tests: a new file `tests/factory/test_superseded_plan.py`, black-box through `bin/factory` on throwaway stores. It covers re-spec after planning with one sub-ticket closed, one merged and one never started. In that case the new plan's sub-ticket is ready, `closed` is empty and parent-check reaches `ready-for-parent-verify`. It also covers the dependency refusal, a same-version second plan superseding nothing, the null-`planned_from` fallback, and a moved `spec` record not changing the split.

G. Documents:
- `docs/design.md:109`: append to the bullet that a new plan made from a later approved version supersedes the earlier plan's sub-tickets that have not merged. They keep their records and ids, are no longer dispatched, and neither park the parent nor hold back its close. Merged ones stay merged and count toward the close.
- `dev/build-harness.spec.md:286`: in the `ready-implementers` JSON description, add that sub-tickets a later plan superseded are listed under `superseded` and left out of every other list except `subtickets`.
- `README.md`: add a bullet `- **Re-plan after a re-spec.**` to the list of what runs, after "Sibling tests check". It should say what superseded means and that merged work stays. Like its neighbours, it should end by saying it is tested and has not yet fired on a real ticket. Bump the status date.
- `docs/changelog.md`: one entry, `<n>. After issue #77 (2026-10-08), ...`, numbered after the last. It names `planned_from`, superseded sub-tickets, and the `Depends on` refusal.

Size: about 60 changed lines of harness code, a test file of about 150 lines and about 15 lines of documents.

## Tests to change

none. No decision overturns behaviour an existing test pins. The prototype of A-E passed the whole suite unchanged: `384 passed`.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A plan made from a later approved version supersedes the earlier plan's unmerged sub-tickets
A sub-ticket SHALL record the parent's approved version it was planned from, and that record MUST NOT follow later changes to its `spec` record. Once a parent has a sub-ticket planned from a later version, each of its sub-tickets that is not merged and was planned from an earlier version MUST be listed as superseded and left out of every other list `ticket ready-implementers` returns except `subtickets`. Its record SHALL be kept. `subticket add` SHALL report and log the sub-tickets it supersedes. A record with no plan version SHALL fall back to its `spec.approved_version`.

#### Scenario: After a re-spec and a re-plan, only the new plan's sub-tickets count and the old records are kept
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `git` and `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell. This scenario needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- GIVEN the fixture file written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

#### Scenario: The plan a sub-ticket belongs to does not move with its spec record, and a record without it falls back to its creation version
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "After a re-spec and a re-plan, only the new plan's sub-tickets count and the old records are kept" run once. The first part moves T-0001.3's `spec` record to v2, as an amendment under approved T-0027 would. The second part clears `planned_from` on every record, as on a record made before this change.

#### Scenario: A second plan at the same approved version supersedes nothing
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && printf 'ST-1 / First\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n\nST-2 / Second\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan1.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan1.md >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket set T-0001.1 status=merged >/dev/null && printf 'ST-1 / Extra\nDepends on: T-0001.2\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan2.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan2.md >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$?"; bin/factory ticket ready-implementers T-0001 | tail -1 | grep -o '"ready": \[[^]]*\]\|"remaining": \[[^]]*\]')`
- THEN it prints exactly `exit=0`, then `"ready": ["T-0001.2"]`, then `"remaining": ["T-0001.2", "T-0001.3"]`

### Requirement: A new plan may not depend on a sub-ticket it supersedes
`factory subticket add` MUST refuse with exit 2, writing no sub-ticket, a plan whose `Depends on:` line names a sub-ticket that the plan supersedes, and the refusal SHALL name that sub-ticket.

#### Scenario: A plan that depends on an old unmerged sub-ticket is refused and writes nothing
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "After a re-spec and a re-plan, only the new plan's sub-tickets count and the old records are kept" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0038-respec.sh && printf 'ST-1 / Redo\nDepends on: T-0001.3\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan3.md; bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan3.md >/dev/null 2>$T23/err; echo "exit=$? names=$(grep -c 'T-0001.3' $T23/err) $(ls $FACTORY_STATE/tickets | tr '\n' ' ')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `exit=2 names=1 T-0001.1.yaml T-0001.2.yaml T-0001.3.yaml T-0001.yaml `

### Requirement: The planner is told which sub-tickets its plan will supersede
When a plan made at the parent's approved version would supersede existing sub-tickets, the planner's input SHALL name them on one line after the existing sub-ticket list, and that list SHALL be unchanged.

#### Scenario: A re-specced parent's planner input names the sub-tickets its plan supersedes
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "After a re-spec and a re-plan, only the new plan's sub-tickets count and the old records are kept" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0038-respec.sh && R=$(bin/factory run start --role planner --ticket T-0001 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'); [ -n "$R" ] && bin/factory run compose $R >/dev/null; I=$FACTORY_STATE/runs/${R:-none}/input.md; echo "said=$(cat $I 2>/dev/null | grep -cxF 'Not merged and planned from an earlier approved version, so a new plan supersedes them and may not depend on them: T-0001.2, T-0001.3') listed=$(cat $I 2>/dev/null | grep -cxF -e '- T-0001.1 / Base: merged' -e '- T-0001.2 / Dropped: closed' -e '- T-0001.3 / Unstarted: waiting-dependencies')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `said=1 listed=3`

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The build counts only the current plan's sub-tickets
The build MUST NOT park a parent for a superseded sub-ticket the human closed, and SHALL dispatch the current plan's ready sub-tickets. A closed sub-ticket of the current plan MUST still park the parent with `sub-ticket closed by a human: <id>`.

#### Scenario: The build of a re-planned parent dispatches the new sub-ticket instead of parking on the old one
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A test file a merged sibling added may be listed, and a mention outside Tests to change is ignored", "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "After a re-spec and a re-plan, only the new plan's sub-tickets count and the old records are kept" run once. In `t0022-build.mjs` every role run returns an empty string, so the implementer of the dispatched sub-ticket ends EMPTY-OUTPUT twice.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0038-respec.sh && printf 'ST-1 / Redo\nDepends on: T-0001.1\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan2.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan2.md >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to planned --by t >/dev/null; node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-build.mjs)`
- THEN it prints exactly `park T-0001.4: EMPTY-OUTPUT from implementer`

#### Scenario: A sub-ticket of the current plan that a human closed still parks the parent
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A test file a merged sibling added may be listed, and a mention outside Tests to change is ignored" and "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && printf 'ST-1 / First\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n\nST-2 / Second\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan1.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan1.md >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to planned --by t >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket transition T-0001.2 --to closed --by t >/dev/null; node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-build.mjs)`
- THEN it prints exactly `park T-0001: sub-ticket closed by a human: T-0001.2`

### Requirement: A parent's final check and close count only the current plan's sub-tickets
`factory ticket parent-check` SHALL move a planned parent to `ready-for-parent-verify` when every current sub-ticket has merged, and `ticket transition <parent> --to closed` MUST accept a VERIFIED final check whatever its superseded sub-tickets' states.

#### Scenario: With the new plan merged, the re-planned parent reaches its final check and closes
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "After a re-spec and a re-plan, only the new plan's sub-tickets count and the old records are kept" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0038-respec.sh && printf 'ST-1 / Redo\nDepends on: T-0001.1\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan2.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan2.md >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to planned --by t >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket set T-0001.4 status=merged >/dev/null; echo "check: $(bin/factory ticket parent-check T-0001 | tail -1 | grep -o '"state": "[^"]*"')"; R=$(bin/factory run start --role verifier --ticket T-0001 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'); if [ -n "$R" ]; then H=$(sed -n "s/^head: '*\([0-9a-f]*\).*/\1/p" $FACTORY_STATE/runs/$R/meta.yaml); printf "Commit: $H\nGate suite: PASS\nSTATUS: VERIFIED\nCONFIDENCE: high, fixture\nESCALATIONS: none\n" > $FACTORY_STATE/runs/$R/output.md; bin/factory run finish $R >/dev/null 2>&1; fi; bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to closed --by t >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "close=$? $(bin/factory ticket show T-0001 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `check: "state": "ready-for-parent-verify"`, then `close=0 closed`

=== specs/human-resolution/spec.md
## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A re-plan returns a fully merged parent to its planner
`factory resolve <parent> --replan F` on a parked parent whose current sub-tickets have all merged MUST move it to `ready-for-planner` with F as its next ruling, and the next planner input SHALL contain F and list each existing sub-ticket with its title and state; a sub-ticket that a later plan superseded SHALL NOT count, and with any current sub-ticket not merged it MUST refuse, naming that sub-ticket, and write nothing.

#### Scenario: A re-plan sends a parent whose sub-tickets all merged back to its planner with the note and the sub-ticket list
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-closed.sh && printf 'Re-plan: add one fix for the case-insensitive path.\n' > $T23/note.md; bin/factory resolve T-0001 --replan $T23/note.md >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$? $(bin/factory ticket show T-0001 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')"; R=$(bin/factory run start --role planner --ticket T-0001 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'); [ -n "$R" ] && bin/factory run compose $R >/dev/null; I=$FACTORY_STATE/runs/${R:-none}/input.md; echo "in_input=$(cat $I 2>/dev/null | grep -c 'Re-plan: add one fix') listed=$(cat $I 2>/dev/null | grep -cxF -e '- T-0001.1 / First: merged' -e '- T-0001.2 / Second: merged')")`
- THEN it prints `exit=0 ready-for-planner`, then `in_input=1 listed=2`

#### Scenario: A re-plan is refused while a sub-ticket is not merged
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-closed.sh && bin/factory ticket set T-0001.2 status=closed >/dev/null && echo n > $T23/note.md; echo "names=$(bin/factory resolve T-0001 --replan $T23/note.md 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep -c 'T-0001.2')"; echo "$(bin/factory ticket show T-0001 | sed -n 's/^status: //p') $(ls $FACTORY_STATE/approvals/T-0001 | tr '\n' ' ')")`
- THEN it prints `names=1`, then `parked spec-v1.yaml ` (still parked, and no ruling file written)

#### Scenario: A re-planned parent whose final check failed can be re-planned again past its superseded sub-tickets
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "After a re-spec and a re-plan, only the new plan's sub-tickets count and the old records are kept" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0038-respec.sh && printf 'ST-1 / Redo\nDepends on: T-0001.1\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan2.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan2.md >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to planned --by t >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket set T-0001.4 status=merged >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket set T-0001 status=ready-for-parent-verify >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket park T-0001 --reason "FAILED from parent-close verifier" >/dev/null && echo 'Re-plan: one more fix.' > $T23/note.md; bin/factory resolve T-0001 --replan $T23/note.md >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$? $(bin/factory ticket show T-0001 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `exit=0 ready-for-planner`

=== specs/harness-docs/spec.md
## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The documents record superseded plans
`docs/design.md` SHALL say, in its rule for a sub-ticket closed by the human, that a new plan from a later approved version supersedes the earlier plan's unmerged sub-tickets. `dev/build-harness.spec.md` SHALL describe the `superseded` list of `ready-implementers`. `README.md` SHALL carry a "Re-plan after a re-spec" bullet. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #77, numbered without a gap. The change MUST NOT touch any prompt copy, workflow script or agent template, and MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design doc, build spec, README and changelog record superseded plans
- WHEN `(echo "design=$(grep 'sub-ticket closed by the human' docs/design.md | grep -c supersede) build-spec=$(grep 'ready-implementers PARENT' dev/build-harness.spec.md | grep -c superseded) readme=$(grep -c '^- \*\*Re-plan after a re-spec\.\*\*' README.md) changelog=$(grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #77 ' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e superseded -e planned_from -e 'Depends on' | sort -u | grep -c .) $(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design=1 build-spec=1 readme=1 changelog=3 CONTIGUOUS`

#### Scenario: The superseded-plan change leaves prompts, workflows and agents alone and adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(echo "whitespace=$(git diff --check main...HEAD >/dev/null && echo ok || echo bad) untouched=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts factory/workflows agents | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `whitespace=ok untouched=0`

=== verification.md
## Acceptance

Each NEW item below was run on this checkout (`main` at `51e2af7`) and printed the "today" output shown. Each item except the documents scenario was also run, verbatim under bash, on a scratch prototype of design.md A-E and printed its THEN. The prototype changed no documents, so the documents scenario printed its "today" line there too. Those runs are from round 1 (run-0346). In round 2, `main` is still at `51e2af7`, and three NEW items were run again verbatim under the HOME wrapper, with the fixtures written to this run's scratch directory. "After a re-spec and a re-plan...", "The build of a re-planned parent..." and "A plan that depends on an old unmerged sub-ticket..." printed exactly the "today" output below. The prototype was not rebuilt in round 2, because this round changes only the wording of proposal.md.

- After a re-spec and a re-plan, only the new plan's sub-tickets count and the old records are kept → NEW. Today it prints `add: ` (no `superseded` in the output), `ready: "ready": ["T-0001.4"]`, `closed: "closed": ["T-0001.2"]`, `superseded: ` (no such list), `kept=T-0001.1.yaml T-0001.2.yaml T-0001.3.yaml T-0001.4.yaml T-0001.yaml logged=0`.
- The plan a sub-ticket belongs to does not move with its spec record, and a record without it falls back to its creation version → NEW. Today it prints `moved: `, then `unrecorded: `: there is no `superseded` list, and `ticket set ... planned_from=` is refused as an unknown key. An implementation that read `spec.approved_version` instead would leave `T-0001.3` out of the `moved` list (worked from the rule in design.md B; not run).
- A second plan at the same approved version supersedes nothing → REGRESSION (prints its THEN today).
- A plan that depends on an old unmerged sub-ticket is refused and writes nothing → NEW. Today it prints `exit=0 names=0 T-0001.1.yaml T-0001.2.yaml T-0001.3.yaml T-0001.4.yaml T-0001.yaml `: the plan is accepted.
- A re-specced parent's planner input names the sub-tickets its plan supersedes → NEW. Today it prints `said=0 listed=3`.
- The build of a re-planned parent dispatches the new sub-ticket instead of parking on the old one → NEW. Today it prints `park T-0001: sub-ticket closed by a human: T-0001.2`, the Nanobot T-0024 park.
- A sub-ticket of the current plan that a human closed still parks the parent → REGRESSION (prints its THEN today).
- With the new plan merged, the re-planned parent reaches its final check and closes → NEW. Today it prints `check: "state": "planned"`, then `close=2 planned`.
- A re-plan sends a parent whose sub-tickets all merged back to its planner with the note and the sub-ticket list → REGRESSION (current truth, unchanged).
- A re-plan is refused while a sub-ticket is not merged → REGRESSION (current truth, unchanged).
- A re-planned parent whose final check failed can be re-planned again past its superseded sub-tickets → NEW. Today it prints `exit=2 parked`. The refusal is `--replan needs every sub-ticket merged: T-0001.2 is closed, T-0001.3 is waiting-dependencies`.
- The design doc, build spec, README and changelog record superseded plans → NEW. Today it prints `design=0 build-spec=0 readme=0 changelog=0 CONTIGUOUS`.
- The superseded-plan change leaves prompts, workflows and agents alone and adds no whitespace errors → REGRESSION (prints `whitespace=ok untouched=0` on `main`).

## Responses

- [BLOCKING] 6, unglossed "target" and "`factory-store`": FIXED. The Problem's first paragraph now reads "ticket T-0024 on Nanobot, one of the repositories the factory builds in", with no "target". Operator steps now read "On `factory-store`, the branch that holds Nanobot's ticket state". They also gloss `--accept-harness` as the step by which the operator moves Nanobot onto a harness revision, and no longer say "instance".
- [SHOULD-FIX] 6, first paragraph does not say who has the problem: FIXED. The first paragraph now names the operator, glossed as "the person who runs the factory and approves its work". It says the operator can get past the stop only by hand-editing the files where the factory keeps each ticket's state. The Problem now calls the person "the operator" throughout, in place of "the human". The quoted park reason "sub-ticket closed by a human" keeps its words.
- [NIT] 6, "pinned" unglossed: FIXED. Paragraph four now says T-0027 "adds a command that amends an approved spec after planning". It also introduces T-0027 as "approved but not yet built".
- Also changed, for one name per concept (writing standard rule 9): the Problem, Evidence, Out of scope, Risk and Operator steps now all call the Nanobot fix "the hand-made workaround", in place of a mix of that and "stand-in". One Decision now says "the operator approves with `approve-spec --edit`", in place of "the human". The design, the specs and the acceptance are unchanged from v1.

# build-dispatch

## Requirements

### Requirement: A park reason carries the failing command's error
When a store command fails and its relayed stderr is empty, the workflow scripts MUST put the refusal's JSON `error`, or else the exit code, after the reason's prefix, so that no park reason ends blank.

#### Scenario: A refused archive or sub-ticket add parks with the refusal text
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify"}}, "ticket parent-check": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify", "reuse": "run-0001-verifier"}}, "archive": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "no spec store (factory init not run)"}, "exit": 2}}'; node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-planner"}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "PLANNED"}}, "subticket add": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "ST-2: no Depends on line"}, "exit": 2}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `park: archive: no spec store (factory init not run)`, then `start: planner`, then `park: harness-bug: subticket add: ST-2: no Depends on line`

#### Scenario: A refused run start during intake parks with the refusal text
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/intake.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-triage", "round": {"spec": 0}}}, "run start": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "T-0001 is parked, not ready-for-triage"}, "exit": 2}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: triage`, then `park: harness-bug: run start triage: T-0001 is parked, not ready-for-triage`

#### Scenario: A command that prints no JSON parks with its exit code
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify"}}, "ticket parent-check": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify", "reuse": "run-0001-verifier"}}, "archive": {"raw": "", "exit": 1}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `park: archive: exit 1, no JSON on stdout`

### Requirement: The build runs only the checkers a commit still needs
When a sub-ticket reaches the checks without an implementer run in that pass, the build MUST run only the checkers that have no result row on its commit; after an implementer run it SHALL run both.

#### Scenario: A redispatched sub-ticket runs only the checker whose row was set aside
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show T-0001 ": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "planned"}}, "ticket ready-implementers": [{"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": ["T-0001.1"], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}, {"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}], "ticket show T-0001.1": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "checks-in-flight"}}, "ticket head": {"out": {"ok": true, "head": "abababababababababababababababababababab"}}, "results show": {"out": {"ok": true, "rows": {"verifier": "VERIFIED", "ci": "PASS"}, "missing": ["reviewer"]}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "APPROVE"}}, "ticket join": {"out": {"ok": true, "decision": "park", "reason": "stub stop"}}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: reviewer`, then `park: stub stop`

#### Scenario: After an implementer run both checkers run
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show T-0001 ": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "planned"}}, "ticket ready-implementers": [{"out": {"ok": true, "ready": ["T-0001.1"], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}, {"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}], "ticket show T-0001.1": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-implementer"}}, "ticket head": {"out": {"ok": true, "head": "abababababababababababababababababababab"}}, "results show": {"out": {"ok": true, "rows": {"reviewer": "REQUEST-CHANGES", "verifier": "VERIFIED", "ci": "PASS"}, "missing": []}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "READY-FOR-REVIEW"}}, "ticket join": {"out": {"ok": true, "decision": "park", "reason": "stub stop"}}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: implementer`, `start: reviewer`, `start: verifier`, `park: stub stop`, one per line

### Requirement: The workflows' clerk commands carry the dispatcher marker
Every store command that `factory/workflows/intake.js` and `factory/workflows/build.js` send to the clerk MUST carry `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` in its environment assignments, so that a dispatch SHALL still complete on a live store while its own role run is in flight.

#### Scenario: Every clerk command of both workflows carries the marker
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once.
- WHEN `(echo "intake: $(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-count.mjs factory/workflows/intake.js)"; echo "build: $(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-count.mjs factory/workflows/build.js)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `intake: sent unmarked=0`, then `build: sent unmarked=0`

#### Scenario: An intake run against a real store reaches its end with its run in flight
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once. The clerk commands run for real on a scratch instance's own store, from the checkout under test, and the triage run is in flight when the workflow records its result.
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && (cd $T/tgt && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md && $B ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null) && echo "returned=$(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-e2e.mjs $T/tgt/.factory) stored=$(cd $T/tgt && $B ticket show T-0001 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `returned=closed stored=closed`

### Requirement: An implementer starts only when each sibling-added test it may change came from a merged sibling
`factory run start --role implementer` on a sub-ticket MUST refuse with exit 2, writing no run, worktree, branch or in-flight entry, with an error that starts `BLOCKED from harness: ` and names the file, when a line `` `<file>` (added by <ID>) `` inside its "Tests to change" field names a file that existed at the parent's base, or whose first adding commit on the integration branch since that base lies inside no merged sibling's recorded merge. It SHALL accept a file a merged sibling's merge added, and SHALL ignore such a line outside that field.

#### Scenario: A test file a merged sibling added may be listed, and a mention outside Tests to change is ignored
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `git` and `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the two fixture files written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names them reuses them)

```sh

# tests/test_interim.py from ST-1's recorded merge, and tests/test_operator.py from a later direct

- THEN it prints exactly `exit=0 ready-for-implementer runs=1`

#### Scenario: A listed test that predates the plan, came from no sibling's merge, or was never added is refused before the implementer starts
Needs the GIVEN block of "A test file a merged sibling added may be listed, and a mention outside Tests to change is ignored" run once.
- WHEN `(for E in tests/test_old.py tests/test_operator.py tests/test_never.py; do (. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-sib.sh && bin/factory run start --role implementer --ticket T-0001.2 >$T22/o 2>/dev/null; x=$?; J=$(tail -1 $T22/o); echo "exit=$x blocked=$(echo "$J" | grep -c '"error": "BLOCKED from harness: ') names=$(echo "$J" | grep -cF "$E") runs=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs 2>/dev/null | grep -c .) branch=$(git -C $FACTORY_REPO branch --list 'factory/T-0001.2' | grep -c .) $(bin/factory ticket show T-0001.2 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')"); done)`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `exit=2 blocked=1 names=1 runs=0 branch=0 ready-for-implementer`

### Requirement: The build parks a harness-blocked sub-ticket as BLOCKED, so a ruling returns it
When an implementer's run start is refused with an error that starts `BLOCKED `, the build workflow SHALL park the sub-ticket with that error, verbatim, as the reason, so that `factory resolve <id> --ruling F` MUST accept the park and return the sub-ticket to `ready-for-implementer`.

#### Scenario: The build parks the blocked sub-ticket with the harness's reason, and a ruling sends it back
Needs the GIVEN block of "A test file a merged sibling added may be listed, and a mention outside Tests to change is ignored" run once.
- WHEN `(E=tests/test_old.py; . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-sib.sh && node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-build.mjs | sed 's/\(BLOCKED from harness:\).*/\1/'; printf 'Ruling: x\n' > $T22/r.md; bin/factory resolve T-0001.2 --ruling $T22/r.md >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "ruling=$? $(bin/factory ticket show T-0001.2 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `park T-0001.2: BLOCKED from harness:`, then `ruling=0 ready-for-implementer`

### Requirement: The build asks the whole-spec step before it runs the planner
At `ready-for-planner`, `factory/workflows/build.js` MUST first run `plan whole-spec`. On `"planner": "skipped"` it SHALL move the parent to `planned` and build the sub-ticket with no planner run. On any other success it SHALL run the planner as before. On a refusal it MUST park the parent with `harness-bug: plan whole-spec: <error>`.

#### Scenario: A qualifying spec reaches its implementer with no planner run, and a refused whole-spec step parks with its error
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show T-0001 ": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-planner"}}, "plan whole-spec": {"out": {"ok": true, "planner": "skipped", "reason": "fixture", "subtickets": [{"id": "T-0001.1"}]}}, "ticket ready-implementers": [{"out": {"ok": true, "ready": ["T-0001.1"], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}, {"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}], "ticket show T-0001.1": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-implementer"}}, "ticket head": {"out": {"ok": true, "head": "abababababababababababababababababababab"}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "READY-FOR-REVIEW"}}, "ticket join": {"out": {"ok": true, "decision": "park", "reason": "stub stop"}}}'; node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-planner"}}, "plan whole-spec": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "T-0001 has no approved spec"}, "exit": 2}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: implementer`, `start: reviewer`, `start: verifier`, `park: stub stop`, `park: harness-bug: plan whole-spec: T-0001 has no approved spec`, one per line

#### Scenario: A spec that needs the planner still gets a planner run
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-planner"}}, "plan whole-spec": {"out": {"ok": true, "planner": "needed", "reason": "the spec writer marked it NEEDS-SPLIT"}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "PLANNED"}}, "subticket add": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "stub stop"}, "exit": 2}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: planner`, then `park: harness-bug: subticket add: stub stop`

### Requirement: A role run that leaves no output is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT
When a role run ends without an output file, or with a blank one, whatever the agent call returned, `run finish` MUST record it as `EMPTY-OUTPUT` and never as `KILLED`. The workflow MUST keep the agent's non-blank last message as that run's `last-message.md` and re-dispatch the same role once. A second `EMPTY-OUTPUT` in a row SHALL park the ticket as `EMPTY-OUTPUT from <role>`, with no result row for that run.

#### Scenario: A reviewer that ends its turn waiting on its own commands is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT beside the verifier's passing rows
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `git` and `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell. This scenario needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.

#### Scenario: One empty reviewer run followed by a real one routes on the real one
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "A reviewer that ends its turn waiting on its own commands is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT beside the verifier's passing rows" run once. The first reviewer call returns `null`; the verifier's SPEC-DEFECT gives the join a fixed stop.

### Requirement: A role run that writes its output runs once and routes on its STATUS
A role run whose output file holds a STATUS MUST NOT be re-dispatched, and the build SHALL route on that STATUS as before.

## Current truth: gate-commands

# gate-commands

## Requirements

### Requirement: A gate command may declare its paths and is skipped for a sub-ticket that touches none of them
Each `gate_commands` entry SHALL be a command string or a mapping of `command` and an optional `paths` list of git pathspecs. When a reviewer or verifier run starts on a sub-ticket, the harness MUST mark SKIPPED, with its reason, each command whose paths the diff from base to head touches none of. It MUST list that command apart from the commands to run, and record it in the run's `meta.yaml`. A command with no `paths` SHALL always be listed to run.

#### Scenario: A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the fixture file written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

# Sourced from the repo root, with $1 the file the sub-ticket's one commit changes (docs/b.md or

# to `src/`; `plain` keeps the fixture's one unscoped command. Sub-ticket T-0001.1 reaches
# checks-in-flight with that commit as its head; a verifier run is started and composed on it.

### Requirement: A skipped command is recorded on the gate result, and the merge still needs that result to pass
When a verifier's result is recorded, the `ci` row MUST list each command that verifier run skipped, with status SKIPPED and its reason. `factory merge` SHALL still refuse unless that row is PASS.

#### Scenario: A skipped gate command is recorded on the gate result, and the merge still needs a passing gate
Needs the GIVEN block of "A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them" run once.

- THEN it prints exactly `FAIL: merge=2 recorded=yes`, then `PASS: merge=0 recorded=yes`

### Requirement: The implementer is given every gate command
The implementer's input SHALL list every gate command to run, scoped or not, and no SKIPPED line.

#### Scenario: The implementer is still given every gate command
Needs the GIVEN block of "A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them" run once.

- THEN it prints exactly `compose=0 both=1 skipped=0`

### Requirement: A malformed gate entry refuses every build role's run start
A `gate_commands` entry MUST make `run start` refuse with exit 2 for the implementer, reviewer or verifier, naming `gate_commands` and creating no run, when it is anything other than one of these: a string; or a mapping with a non-empty string `command`, an optional non-empty list of non-empty strings `paths`, and no other key.

#### Scenario: A malformed gate entry refuses a checker's run start and creates no run
Needs the GIVEN block of "A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them" run once.

`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain entry 51 covering every part, numbered without a gap, `README.md` SHALL describe the new `resolve` behaviour and relative environment paths, and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the change in order
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print n, (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; sed -n '/^51\. /p' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e BLOCKED -e '--replan' -e 'next free' -e 'error text' -e redispatch -e '-whitespace' -e context.md -e relative -e uncommitted | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `51 CONTIGUOUS`, then `9`

#### Scenario: The README describes the new resolve verbs
- WHEN `(echo "replan=$(grep -c -- '--replan' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') gap=$(grep -c 'has no .resolve. verb' README.md)")`
- THEN it prints `replan=1 gap=0`

#### Scenario: The README says relative paths resolve from the caller's directory
- WHEN `(grep -c 'relative .FACTORY_' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')`
- THEN it prints `1`

#### Scenario: The change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the live-store guard
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for this change as its last numbered entry, numbered without a gap; `docs/design.md` SHALL describe the dispatcher marker and the run-directory rule; README's "Where a human decides" SHALL open with the marker's exact command form and say that the refusal deliberately does not name it; README SHALL say the final verifier run is listed as in flight and SHALL no longer say the factory's capabilities never entered the spec store; no prompt copy under `docs/prompts/` or `factory/prompts/` SHALL change; and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the guard as its last entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -oF -e FACTORY_DISPATCH -e 'in flight' -e throwaway -e 'exit 2' -e 'worktrees/' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: The design doc names the marker and the run-directory rule, and no prompt copy changes
- WHEN `(echo "design=$(grep -c FACTORY_DISPATCH docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') dirs=$(grep FACTORY_DISPATCH docs/design.md | grep -c 'worktrees/' | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') prompts=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design=1 dirs=1 prompts=0`

#### Scenario: README tells the operator how to write during a run, first thing under Where a human decides
- WHEN `(H=$(sed -n '/^## Where a human decides/,/^## What is built/p' README.md); J=$(echo "$H" | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "first=$(echo "$H" | sed -n '3p' | grep -c 'FACTORY_DISPATCH=1') command=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 [^ ]*bin/factory ') unnamed=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'deliberately does not name the marker') export=$(echo "$J" | grep -ci 'never export') rundirs=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'worktrees/')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `first=1 command=1 unnamed=1 export=1 rundirs=1`

#### Scenario: README says the final verifier run is listed as in flight
- WHEN `(R=$(tr '\n' ' ' < README.md | tr -s ' '); echo "stale=$(echo "$R" | grep -o 'does not list it as in flight' | grep -c .) listed=$(echo "$R" | grep -o 'lists it as in flight' | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `stale=0 listed=1`

#### Scenario: README no longer says the factory's capabilities never entered the spec store
- WHEN `(echo "bullet=$(grep -c 'Current truth for the factory itself' README.md) stale=$(grep -c 'never entered it' README.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `bullet=1 stale=0`

#### Scenario: The guard change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents describe the store branch
The design doc SHALL name the store branch `factory-store` and the never-tracked path rule, and the build spec SHALL call the store branch only `factory-store`. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one contiguously numbered entry recording the change. `README.md` SHALL describe committing the store on its branch, `factory store migrate`, the `git clean -ffdx` hazard and a checkout from before the move, and SHALL no longer say that a store commit moves the integration branch or give `.factory/state/` as the live store's location. The change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design doc names the store branch and the path rule
- WHEN `(Q=$(printf '\140'); echo "store_branch=$(grep -c 'factory-store' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') tickets_branch=$(grep -c "${Q}tickets${Q} branch" docs/design.md) never_tracked=$(grep -c 'never tracked' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints `store_branch=1 tickets_branch=0 never_tracked=1`

#### Scenario: The build spec calls the store branch factory-store
- WHEN `(Q=$(printf '\140'); echo "old_name=$(grep -c "${Q}tickets${Q}\|refs/heads/tickets\|HEAD:tickets" dev/build-harness.spec.md) new_name=$(grep -c 'factory-store' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints `old_name=0 new_name=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records the store branch in one contiguous entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep -E '^[0-9]+\. ' docs/changelog.md | grep 'factory-store' | grep -c 'never tracked')`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`

#### Scenario: The README describes the store branch and the move
`old_cost` joins the page into one line first, because the retired clause is wrapped across two lines. `old_refs` counts only the places that give the live store's location, so a how-to may still name the path a store moves from.
- WHEN `(Q=$(printf '\140'); echo "store_branch=$(grep -c 'factory-store' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') migrate=$(grep -c 'factory store migrate' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') ffdx=$(grep -c -- '-ffdx' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') premove=$(grep -c 'from before the move' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') old_cost=$(tr '\n' ' ' < README.md | grep -c 'committing the store to the same branch') old_refs=$(grep -c "\.factory/state/\(log\|tickets\)\|(${Q}\.factory/state/${Q})\|at ${Q}\.factory/state/${Q}" README.md)")`
- THEN it prints `store_branch=1 migrate=1 ffdx=1 premove=1 old_cost=0 old_refs=0`

#### Scenario: The store-branch change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The planner labels checks per sub-ticket and may list tests an earlier sibling added
Every copy of the planner prompt (the `docs/design.md` §4 block, `docs/prompts/04-planner.md`, `factory/prompts/planner.md`) SHALL tell the planner to label each check against the sub-ticket's own base, to name interim tests, and to list a sibling-added test as `` `<file>[::<test>]` (added by <sibling ID>): <reason> ``; it MUST no longer say to label checks "the same way", and the design block and its `docs/prompts/` copy SHALL stay byte-identical.

#### Scenario: Every planner copy labels per sub-ticket and lists sibling tests
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-planner.txt; sed -n '/^## 4\. Planner/,/^## 5\. /p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/04-planner.md factory/prompts/planner.md; do echo "own=$(grep -c "against this sub-ticket's own base" $f) sibling=$(grep -cF '(added by <sibling ID>)' $f) interim=$(grep -c '^  Interim tests: ' $f) copied=$(grep -c 'labelled NEW or REGRESSION the same way' $f)"; done; cmp -s $X docs/prompts/04-planner.md && echo verbatim || echo differs)`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `own=1 sibling=1 interim=1 copied=0`, then `verbatim`

### Requirement: The spec writer lists the tests a decision overturns, and the critic checks for one left off
Every copy of the spec writer prompt SHALL carry the RULES bullet that starts `- Tests a decision overturns: `, and every copy of the critic prompt SHALL say under rubric 1 that a test pinning the old behaviour and `missing from "Tests to change" is a finding`.

#### Scenario: Every spec writer and critic copy carries the decision-overturns rule
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-sw.txt; for h in '2\. Spec writer' '3\. Spec critic'; do sed -n "/^## $h/,/^## [0-9]/p" docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p"; done > $X; echo "design: writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' $X) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' $X)"; echo "docs/prompts: writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md)"; echo "factory/prompts: writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' factory/prompts/spec_writer.md) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' factory/prompts/critic.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design: writer=1 critic=1`, then `docs/prompts: writer=1 critic=1`, then `factory/prompts: writer=1 critic=1`

### Requirement: The preamble and the code reviewer accept a checked sibling entry
Every copy of the preamble SHALL allow an existing test listed `in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling`, and every copy of the code reviewer prompt SHALL not block a test `the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling`.

#### Scenario: Every preamble and reviewer copy accepts a sibling entry
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-pr.txt; for h in 'Shared preamble' '6\. Code reviewer'; do sed -n "/^## $h/,/^## [0-9A-Z]/p" docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p"; done > $X; echo "design: guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' $X) review=$(grep -c 'or the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling' $X)"; echo "docs/prompts: guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' docs/prompts/00-preamble.md) review=$(grep -c 'or the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling' docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md)"; echo "factory/prompts: guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' factory/prompts/preamble.md) review=$(grep -c 'or the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling' factory/prompts/reviewer.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design: guard=1 review=1`, then `docs/prompts: guard=1 review=1`, then `factory/prompts: guard=1 review=1`

### Requirement: Role runs receive the new rules
The system prompt that `run start` writes for a planner, spec writer and critic run SHALL contain that role's new rule and the new preamble sentence.

#### Scenario: Planner, spec writer and critic runs get the new rules in their system prompts
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s; for i in 1 2 3; do printf "# F$i\n\nDo x.\n" > $T/req$i.md; bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req$i.md >/dev/null; done; bin/factory ticket set T-0001 status=ready-for-planner >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0002 status=ready-for-spec-writer >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0003 status=ready-for-critic >/dev/null; for p in planner:T-0001 spec_writer:T-0002 critic:T-0003; do bin/factory run start --role ${p%%:*} --ticket ${p##*:} >/dev/null 2>&1; done; P=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-planner/system-prompt.txt); W=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-spec_writer/system-prompt.txt); C=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-critic/system-prompt.txt); echo "planner own=$(grep -c "against this sub-ticket's own base" $P) sibling=$(grep -cF '(added by <sibling ID>)' $P) guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' $P) writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' $W) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' $C)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `planner own=1 sibling=1 guard=1 writer=1 critic=1`

### Requirement: The documents record the sibling-tests check
`docs/design.md` SHALL describe the check in a paragraph that starts `**Tests a sibling added.**`, in piece 8 and in the spec approval gate row, and SHALL no longer call the gate's list the only authorization to alter an existing test; `dev/build-harness.spec.md` SHALL name the `BLOCKED from harness` refusal; `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain an entry for issue #40 and stay numbered without a gap; `README.md` SHALL describe the check and the new `--ruling` case; and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design doc and build spec describe the check
- WHEN `(echo "piece8=$(grep '^| 8 |' docs/design.md | grep -c 'added by that sibling') gate=$(grep '^| Spec approval |' docs/design.md | grep -c 'a test an earlier sibling added') stale=$(grep -c 'which is the only authorization to alter an existing test' docs/design.md) check=$(grep -c '^\*\*Tests a sibling added\.\*\*.*BLOCKED from harness:' docs/design.md) build=$(grep -c 'BLOCKED from harness' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `piece8=1 gate=1 stale=0 check=1 build=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records issue 40's change without a numbering gap
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #40 ' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e 'own base' -e 'added by' -e 'BLOCKED from harness' -e 'Decision' -e 'critic rubric 1' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: README describes the sibling tests check and its ruling
- WHEN `(echo "built=$(grep -c '^- \*\*Sibling tests check\.\*\*' README.md) ruling=$(grep '^| \*\*Unstick\*\*' README.md | grep -c 'a test no merged sibling added')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `built=1 ruling=1`

#### Scenario: The sibling-tests change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the declared-path rule
The "## 5. Implementer" and "## 7. Verifier" blocks of `docs/design.md` SHALL carry the declared-path rule and stay verbatim copies of `docs/prompts/05-implementer.md` and `docs/prompts/07-verifier.md`. The run copies under `factory/prompts/` SHALL differ from those files only by the fills they had on `main`. The code reviewer and preamble copies MUST NOT change. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for issue #49, numbered without a gap, and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design blocks and their copies carry the rule and stay in step
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); Q=$(printf '\140\140\140'); for r in "5. Implementer|05-implementer.md|implementer" "7. Verifier|07-verifier.md|verifier"; do h=${r%%|*}; x=${r#*|}; c=${x%%|*}; f=${x#*|}; git show main:factory/prompts/$f.md > $T/a; git show main:docs/prompts/$c > $T/b; echo "$f copy=$(awk -v h="## $h" -v q="$Q" '$0==h{s=1;next} s&&$0==q"text"{p=1;next} p&&$0==q{exit} p' docs/design.md | cmp -s - docs/prompts/$c && echo SAME || echo DIFF) rule=$(tr '\n' ' ' < docs/prompts/$c | tr -s ' ' | grep -c 'A protected path the sub-ticket declares is not an escalation') fill=$([ "$(diff factory/prompts/$f.md docs/prompts/$c | grep '^[<>]')" = "$(diff $T/a $T/b | grep '^[<>]')" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer copy=SAME rule=1 fill=unchanged`, then `verifier copy=SAME rule=1 fill=unchanged`. `copy=SAME`: the design block equals its `docs/prompts/` file. `rule=1`: that file carries the rule. `fill=unchanged`: the run copy under `factory/prompts/` differs from the documented copy only where it did on `main`.

#### Scenario: The code reviewer and preamble copies do not change
- WHEN `(echo "changed=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- factory/prompts/reviewer.md factory/prompts/preamble.md docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md docs/prompts/00-preamble.md | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `changed=0`

#### Scenario: The changelog records the declared-path rule in a contiguous entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep -E '^[0-9]+\. ' docs/changelog.md | grep -F '#49' | grep -c 'ESCALATIONS')`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`

#### Scenario: The declared-path change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the small-change lane
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for this change as its last numbered entry, numbered without a gap. `docs/design.md`, `dev/build-harness.spec.md` and `README.md` SHALL describe the whole-spec sub-ticket and gate-command paths. No prompt copy SHALL change, and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the small-change lane as its last entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -oF -e 'paths' -e SKIPPED -e 'plan whole-spec' -e NEEDS-SPLIT -e seams | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: The design doc, build spec and README describe both skips, and no prompt copy changes
- WHEN `(echo "design=$(grep -c 'whole-spec' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') gate=$(grep '^| 11 | Gate runner' docs/design.md | grep -c 'SKIPPED') build=$(grep -c 'plan whole-spec' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') readme=$(grep -c 'plan whole-spec' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') skipped=$(grep -c 'SKIPPED' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') stale=$(grep -c 'The build workflow runs the planner, which' README.md) prompts=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts agents | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design=1 gate=1 build=1 readme=1 skipped=1 stale=0 prompts=0`

#### Scenario: The small-change lane adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: Every role is told to wait for its own commands
Every copy of the shared preamble SHALL carry the bullet that starts `- Run every command in the foreground and wait for it to finish.` and says `Never end your turn while a command you started is still running`. The design block and both files MUST stay byte-identical, and every role run's system prompt SHALL carry the bullet.

#### Scenario: Every preamble copy carries the wait rule and the copies stay identical
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-pre.txt; sed -n '/^## Shared preamble/,/^## [0-9]/p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/00-preamble.md factory/prompts/preamble.md; do echo "fg=$(grep -c '^- Run every command in the foreground and wait for it to finish\.$' $f) end=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $f | tr -s ' ' | grep -c 'Never end your turn while a command you started is still running')"; done; cmp -s $X docs/prompts/00-preamble.md && cmp -s docs/prompts/00-preamble.md factory/prompts/preamble.md && echo verbatim || echo differs)`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `fg=1 end=1`, then `verbatim`

#### Scenario: Implementer, reviewer and verifier run prompts carry the wait rule, and only the reviewer's carries the judge-the-diff rule
Needs the GIVEN block of "Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh && for r in implementer reviewer verifier; do P=$(prompt $r); echo "$r fg=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'Never end your turn while a command you started is still running') judge=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'Do not run the test suite or the gate commands')"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer fg=1 judge=0`, `reviewer fg=1 judge=1`, `verifier fg=1 judge=0`, one per line

### Requirement: The code reviewer judges the diff and leaves the suite and the gate to the verifier
Every copy of the code reviewer prompt SHALL say `Do not run the test suite or the gate commands: the verifier runs them on the same head`, and SHALL allow a narrow command that confirms a specific finding. No existing line of that prompt MAY be removed, and the verifier prompt MUST NOT change. The reviewer's composed input MUST NOT list the gate commands, while the implementer's and the verifier's inputs still SHALL.

#### Scenario: Every reviewer copy carries the rule, keeps every existing line, and the verifier prompt is unchanged
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-rev.txt; T=$(mktemp -d); sed -n '/^## 6\. Code reviewer/,/^## 7\. /p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md factory/prompts/reviewer.md; do J=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $f | tr -s ' '); echo "judge=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'Do not run the test suite or the gate commands: the verifier runs them on the same head') narrow=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'You may run a narrow command to confirm a specific finding')"; done; git show main:factory/prompts/reviewer.md > $T/a; git show main:docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md > $T/b; echo "copy=$(cmp -s $X docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md && echo SAME || echo DIFF) fill=$([ "$(diff factory/prompts/reviewer.md docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md | grep '^[<>]')" = "$(diff $T/a $T/b | grep '^[<>]')" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed) removed=$(git diff main...HEAD -- docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md factory/prompts/reviewer.md | grep -v '^---' | grep -c '^-') verifier_changed=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts/07-verifier.md factory/prompts/verifier.md | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `judge=1 narrow=1`, then `copy=SAME fill=unchanged removed=0 verifier_changed=0`

#### Scenario: The reviewer's input no longer hands it the gate commands, and the implementer's and verifier's still do
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "A reviewer that ends its turn waiting on its own commands is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT beside the verifier's passing rows" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-checks.sh && for r in reviewer verifier implementer; do [ $r = implementer ] && bin/factory ticket set T-0001.1 status=ready-for-implementer 'in_flight=[]' >/dev/null; R=$(bin/factory run start --role $r --ticket T-0001.1 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'); bin/factory run compose ${R:-none} >/dev/null 2>&1; I=$FACTORY_STATE/runs/${R:-none}/input.md; echo "$r gates=$(grep -c 'Gate commands (run each from your worktree' $I 2>/dev/null) told=$(grep -c 'The verifier runs the gate commands on this head; you do not run them' $I 2>/dev/null)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `reviewer gates=0 told=1`, `verifier gates=1 told=0`, `implementer gates=1 told=0`, one per line

### Requirement: The documents record the empty-output route
`docs/design.md` SHALL state the EMPTY-OUTPUT rule and its two routing-table rows, and SHALL list a second EMPTY-OUTPUT among the park reasons. `dev/build-harness.spec.md` SHALL describe EMPTY-OUTPUT and `run last-message`, and SHALL no longer describe a KILLED condition or seam. `README.md` SHALL no longer say that a run is parked for exceeding a budget, and SHALL describe the empty-output retry. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain an entry for issue #41, numbered without a gap. The change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design doc states the EMPTY-OUTPUT rule, its rows and its park
- WHEN `(echo "rule=$(grep -c '^- A role run that ends without writing its output is EMPTY-OUTPUT' docs/design.md) rows=$(grep -c '^| Any role | EMPTY-OUTPUT' docs/design.md) parks=$(grep '^- A non-empty ESCALATIONS line' docs/design.md | grep -c 'a second EMPTY-OUTPUT in a row') kill=$(grep -c 'never recorded as a budget kill' docs/design.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `rule=1 rows=2 parks=1 kill=1`

#### Scenario: The build spec describes EMPTY-OUTPUT and no longer a KILLED condition
- WHEN `(echo "stale=$(grep -c 'KILLED condition\|KILLED seam' dev/build-harness.spec.md) empty=$(grep -c 'EMPTY-OUTPUT' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') note=$(grep -c 'run last-message' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `stale=0 empty=1 note=1`

#### Scenario: README drops the budget park and describes the empty-output retry
- WHEN `(echo "budget=$(grep -c 'exceeding its budget\|over budget' README.md) built=$(grep -c '^- \*\*Empty output\.\*\*' README.md) unstick=$(grep '^| \*\*Unstick\*\*' README.md | grep -c 'ended without output twice')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `budget=0 built=1 unstick=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records issue 41 without a numbering gap
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #41 ' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e EMPTY-OUTPUT -e foreground -e 'last message' -e 're-dispatched once' -e 'gate commands' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: The empty-output change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The spec writer and the critic carry the turn-economy rules
Every copy of the spec writer prompt SHALL tell it to batch independent reads and commands, read line ranges once grep has found them, keep long output in a scratch file, and write the spec in as few writes as it can. Every copy of the critic prompt SHALL carry the same reading rules, its minimum spot-check, a rule that it runs no test suite, the rule for picking an acceptance command, a sentence allowing a small experiment in its scratch directory to confirm a finding, and the rule that turns a claim needing a suite run or a build of the change into a finding or a question; it MUST NOT cap a claim at a number of paths and commands or forbid a clone, worktree or prototype. Each design block MUST stay byte-identical to its `docs/prompts/` copy, and each run copy SHALL differ from it only as it did on `main`.

#### Scenario: Every critic copy drops the cap and the no-build rule and keeps the rest; every writer copy keeps its rules
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); Q=$(printf '\140\140\140'); printf '%s\n' 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn' 'read that line range, not the whole file' 'to a file in your scratch directory and grep or tail it' > $T/both; { cat $T/both; echo 'Write the spec in as few writes as you can'; } > $T/spec_writer; { cat $T/both; printf '%s\n' 'Spot-check at least 2 cited paths and 1 acceptance command yourself' 'Run no test suite' 'Pick an acceptance command that runs no test suite' 'small experiment in your scratch directory' 'is a finding for the writer, or a question'; } > $T/critic; printf '%s\n' 'Ground any one claim' 'build nothing' 'no clone, worktree or prototype' > $T/gone; for r in "2. Spec writer|02-spec-writer.md|spec_writer" "3.

- THEN it prints exactly `spec_writer copy=SAME doc=4/4 run=4/4 gone=0 fill=unchanged`, then `critic copy=SAME doc=8/8 run=8/8 gone=0 fill=unchanged`. `doc` and `run` count the kept or added phrases found in the documented copy and the run copy, each joined into one line so a phrase may wrap; `gone` counts the removed phrases found in either.

### Requirement: Spec writer and critic runs receive the turn-economy rules
The system prompt that `run start` writes for a spec writer run SHALL contain the writer's turn-economy rule. The one it writes for a critic run SHALL contain the critic's reading rules, its no-suite rule and the sentence allowing a small scratch experiment, and MUST NOT contain the per-claim cap or the no-build rule.

#### Scenario: A critic run's prompt has the no-suite rule and the scratch allowance, and no cap or build ban
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s; for i in 1 2; do printf "# F$i\n\nDo x.\n" > $T/req$i.md; bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req$i.md >/dev/null; done; bin/factory ticket set T-0001 status=ready-for-spec-writer >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0002 status=ready-for-critic >/dev/null; bin/factory run start --role spec_writer --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1; bin/factory run start --role critic --ticket T-0002 >/dev/null 2>&1; W=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $FACTORY_STATE/runs/run-0001-spec_writer/system-prompt.txt | tr -s ' '); C=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $FACTORY_STATE/runs/run-0002-critic/system-prompt.txt | tr -s ' '); echo "spec_writer batch=$(printf "%s" "$W" | grep -c 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn') writes=$(printf "%s" "$W" | grep -c 'Write the spec in as few writes as you can')"; echo "critic batch=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn') suite=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Run no test suite') scratch=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'small experiment in your scratch directory') cap=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Ground any one claim') build=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'build nothing')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `spec_writer batch=1 writes=1`, then `critic batch=1 suite=1 scratch=1 cap=0 build=0`

### Requirement: Nothing else in the two prompts changes
The spec writer prompt copies SHALL stay as #73 left them at `05cf8f9`. In the critic prompt copies, everything before the PROCESS section and everything from ANTI-GOODHARTING on SHALL stay byte for byte as on `main`. No other file under `docs/prompts/`, `factory/prompts/` or `agents/` SHALL change.

#### Scenario: The writer prompt is as #73 left it, and only the critic's PROCESS changes
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); n=0; for x in "docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md|1,/^PROCESS\$/p" "docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md|/^ANTI-GOODHARTING/,\$p" "factory/prompts/critic.md|1,/^PROCESS\$/p" "factory/prompts/critic.md|/^ANTI-GOODHARTING/,\$p"; do f=${x%%|*}; s=${x#*|}; git show main:$f | sed -n "$s" > $T/a; sed -n "$s" $f > $T/b; [ -s $T/a ] || n=$((n+100)); cmp -s $T/a $T/b || { n=$((n+1)); echo "changed: $f $s"; }; done; echo "sections_changed=$n writer=$(git diff --name-only 05cf8f9 HEAD -- docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md factory/prompts/spec_writer.md | grep -c .) others=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts agents | grep -vxF -e docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md -e factory/prompts/critic.md | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints only `sections_changed=0 writer=0 others=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the turn-economy change
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #73, numbered without a gap. `docs/principles.md` principle 2 SHALL name the critic's no-suite rule among its mechanisms, SHALL no longer say the critic builds nothing, and SHALL say part B.2 is done by #41 for the code reviewer and by #73 for the critic.

#### Scenario: Principle 2 names the critic's no-suite rule and no longer its build ban
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; P=$(sed -n '/^### 2\. /,/^### 3\. /p' docs/principles.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "entries73=$(grep -c '^[0-9]*\. After issue #73 ' docs/changelog.md) implemented=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'runs no test suite (#73') builds=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'builds nothing') status=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'done by #41 for the code reviewer and by #73 for the critic')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `CONTIGUOUS`, then `entries73=1 implemented=1 builds=0 status=1`

### Requirement: The documents record the critic revert
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for issue #74 as its last numbered entry, numbered without a gap, that records the replay result and the two removed rules. The Spiking section of `docs/principles.md` SHALL no longer bound the critic to two paths and one command or say it does not build, SHALL say the critic may run a small scratch check, SHALL say vetting a whole approach belongs to the spec writer or a spike, and SHALL record the replay. The change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the revert as its last entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -oF -e '#74' -e replay -e 'per-claim cap' -e 'no-build rule' -e 'no test suite' -e UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR -e brace-list | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `7`

#### Scenario: The Spiking section allows a small scratch check and records the replay
- WHEN `(X=$(sed -n '/^## Spiking/,$p' docs/principles.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "bound=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'two paths, one command') nobuild=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'it does not build') scratch=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'small scratch check') whole=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'vetting a whole approach belongs to the spec writer') replay=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'replay')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `bound=0 nobuild=0 scratch=1 whole=1 replay=1`

#### Scenario: The critic revert adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the capability index
The triage prompt's design block, its `docs/prompts/` copy and the runtime prompt SHALL each carry the `Capabilities:` output line. `docs/design.md`, `dev/build-harness.spec.md` and the README's Triage, Spec writer and Spec critic rows MUST describe the capability index. `docs/changelog.md` MUST have an entry for issue #75, with no whitespace error in the change.

#### Scenario: The prompt copies, design, build spec, README and changelog name the capability index
- WHEN `(echo "docs-copy=$(grep -c '^Capabilities:' docs/prompts/01-triage.md) runtime=$(grep -c '^Capabilities:' factory/prompts/triage.md) changelog=$(grep -c '^[0-9]*\. After issue #75 ' docs/changelog.md) design=$(grep -q 'capability index' docs/design.md && echo y || echo n) build-spec=$(grep -q 'capability index' dev/build-harness.spec.md && echo y || echo n) readme=$(grep -E '^\| (Triage|Spec writer|Spec critic) \(' README.md | grep -c 'capability index')"; git diff --check main...HEAD && echo whitespace=ok)`
- THEN it prints exactly `docs-copy=1 runtime=1 changelog=1 design=y build-spec=y readme=3`, then `whitespace=ok`

## Current truth: harness-suite

# harness-suite

## Requirements

### Requirement: The harness suite runs mid-edit without loosening the lock
The harness's own test suite SHALL pass in a checkout that has an uncommitted edit under a harness path, and a store command on an instance's own store run from such a checkout MUST still be refused.

#### Scenario: The harness suite passes with an uncommitted harness edit
The command gives pytest its own temporary directory under `/tmp`, because four existing tests need one outside every repository and instance. Run it as written, whatever `TMPDIR` the caller has set; it removes that directory when it ends.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && P=$(mktemp -d /tmp/t0023-suite.XXXXXX) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && echo '# uncommitted edit' >> $T/c/factory/status.py && cd $T/c && TMPDIR=$P .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | tail -1; rm -rf "$P")`
- THEN it prints one line reporting a number of passed tests and no `failed` or `error`

#### Scenario: The uncommitted-edit refusal still holds on an instance's own store
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && echo '# uncommitted edit' >> $T/c/factory/status.py && git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $T/c/bin/factory init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && $T/c/bin/factory config >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$?"; head -1 $T/err | grep -o 'has uncommitted changes:$')`
- THEN it prints `exit=2`, then `has uncommitted changes:`

## Current truth: human-resolution

# human-resolution

## Requirements

### Requirement: A ruling returns a BLOCKED sub-ticket to its implementer
`factory resolve <id> --ruling F` on a park whose reason starts with `BLOCKED` MUST write F as the ticket's next ruling, return it to `ready-for-implementer` at the same round, and the next implementer input SHALL contain the ruling.

#### Scenario: A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.

### Requirement: Existing ruling routes are unchanged
A ruling on a critic ESCALATE park SHALL still return the ticket to `ready-for-critic`.

#### Scenario: A ruling on a critic ESCALATE still returns the ticket to the critic
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); export FACTORY_STATE=$T/store; printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md; bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to ready-for-spec-writer --by t >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to ready-for-critic --by t >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket park T-0001 --reason "ESCALATE from critic" >/dev/null; echo r > $T/r.md; bin/factory resolve T-0001 --ruling $T/r.md >/dev/null; echo "exit=$? $(bin/factory ticket show T-0001 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`

### Requirement: A re-plan returns a fully merged parent to its planner
`factory resolve <parent> --replan F` on a parked parent whose sub-tickets have all merged MUST move it to `ready-for-planner` with F as its next ruling, and the next planner input SHALL contain F and list each existing sub-ticket with its title and state; with any sub-ticket not merged it MUST refuse, naming that sub-ticket, and write nothing.

#### Scenario: A re-plan sends a parent whose sub-tickets all merged back to its planner with the note and the sub-ticket list
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-closed.sh && printf 'Re-plan: add one fix for the case-insensitive path.\n' > $T23/note.md; bin/factory resolve T-0001 --replan $T23/note.md >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$? $(bin/factory ticket show T-0001 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')"; R=$(bin/factory run start --role planner --ticket T-0001 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'); [ -n "$R" ] && bin/factory run compose $R >/dev/null; I=$FACTORY_STATE/runs/${R:-none}/input.md; echo "in_input=$(cat $I 2>/dev/null | grep -c 'Re-plan: add one fix') listed=$(cat $I 2>/dev/null | grep -cxF -e '- T-0001.1 / First: merged' -e '- T-0001.2 / Second: merged')")`

### Requirement: A redispatch sets aside only rows that did not pass
`factory resolve <id> --redispatch` MUST keep a reviewer row that is `APPROVE`, and the verifier and gate rows together when they are `VERIFIED` and `PASS`, and SHALL move every other row of that commit to `superseded-<n>/`.

#### Scenario: A redispatch after a killed reviewer keeps the verifier's passing rows

- THEN it prints `kept: reviewer.yaml `, then `set aside: ci.yaml verifier.yaml `

## Current truth: live-store-guard

# live-store-guard

## Requirements

### Requirement: Unmarked writes to a live store are refused while a role run is in flight there
While any run is in flight on an instance's own store, every `factory` command on that store except `ticket show`, `ticket join`, `results show`, `config`, `status parse`, `log tail` and `paths` (and any command given `--accept-harness`) MUST be refused with exit 2, writing nothing to the store, the instance or the repository, unless its environment has `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1`; the refusal SHALL name a throwaway `FACTORY_STATE` and SHALL NOT name the marker.

#### Scenario: Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.

#### Scenario: A harness acceptance is refused while a run is in flight
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once.

- THEN it prints exactly `accept=2 store=unchanged`

### Requirement: Writes from inside a store's run directories or code checkouts are refused, marked or not
Every `factory` command on an instance's own store except the read-only list above MUST be refused with exit 2, writing nothing, when the caller's directory lies under that store's `runs/` or `worktrees/`, whether or not its environment has `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` and whether or not any run is in flight.

#### Scenario: Marked writes from a run's scratch directory or a worktree directory are refused, init included
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-inflight.sh && rm -rf $T/tgt/.claude $S/openspec $S/decisions.md && mkdir -p $S/worktrees/T-0001/sub && S0=$(snap); cd $W && FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 $B decision add T-0001 x >/dev/null 2>&1; d=$?; FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 $B init --repo-name x >/dev/null 2>&1; i=$?; cd $S/worktrees/T-0001/sub && FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 $B ticket new --file $T/req2.md >/dev/null 2>&1; n=$?; echo "scratch_decision=$d scratch_init=$i worktree_new=$n store=$([ "$(snap)" = "$S0" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed) agents=$([ -e $T/tgt/.claude ] && echo written || echo none)")`

- THEN it prints exactly `idle=1 new=2 decision=2 store=unchanged`

### Requirement: Reads, marked commands from outside the store, throwaway stores and idle stores stay open
While a run is in flight on the live store, the read-only commands SHALL succeed from anywhere, a command with `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` run from outside the store's `runs/` and `worktrees/` SHALL succeed as before, and a command on a throwaway store (`FACTORY_STATE` naming another store) SHALL NOT be fenced from any directory; with no run in flight, unmarked writes from outside those directories SHALL succeed as before.

#### Scenario: Read commands still answer while a run is in flight
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-inflight.sh && $B ticket show T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1; s=$?; $B config >/dev/null 2>&1; c=$?; $B log tail >/dev/null 2>&1; l=$?; $B results show T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1; r=$?; cd $W && $B ticket show T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1; w=$?; echo "show=$s config=$c log=$l results=$r inside=$w")`

- THEN it prints exactly `init=0 new=0`

#### Scenario: With no run in flight, unmarked commands write as before

- THEN it prints exactly `new=0 decision=0`

### Requirement: The marker does not lift the harness lock
A command with `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` on an instance's own store MUST still be refused by the harness lock's uncommitted-edit check, with exit 2 and nothing written, whether or not a run is in flight.

#### Scenario: A marked write from a harness checkout with an uncommitted edit is still refused
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $T/c/bin/factory init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md && $T/c/bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null && $T/c/bin/factory run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null && echo '# uncommitted edit' >> $T/c/factory/status.py && S0=$(find $T/tgt/.factory -type f -exec cksum {} + | sort | cksum) && FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 $T/c/bin/factory decision add T-0001 x >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? lock=$(head -1 $T/err | grep -c 'has uncommitted changes:$') store=$([ "$(find $T/tgt/.factory -type f -exec cksum {} + | sort | cksum)" = "$S0" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `exit=2 lock=1 store=unchanged`

## Current truth: merge-gate

# merge-gate

## Requirements

### Requirement: A store commit does not hold back a merge
On an instance whose store is the checkout of `factory-store`, a store commit made after a sub-ticket's checks SHALL NOT stop `factory merge` from merging that sub-ticket.

#### Scenario: A sub-ticket merges after a store commit
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-gate.sh && git -C .factory/state add -A && git -C .factory/state commit -q -m "store: rows recorded"; $B merge T-0001 >/dev/null 2>$T25/err; echo "exit=$? refused=$(grep -c 'head does not contain main' $T25/err)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=0 refused=0`

### Requirement: A commit to the integration branch still holds back a merge
`factory merge` MUST still refuse, with `head does not contain main`, a sub-ticket whose head does not contain a commit made to the integration branch after its checks.

#### Scenario: A sub-ticket is refused after a code commit to main
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-gate.sh && echo y > y.txt && git add y.txt && git commit -q -m "code on main"; $B merge T-0001 >/dev/null 2>$T25/err; echo "exit=$? refused=$(grep -c 'head does not contain main' $T25/err)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 refused=1`

## Current truth: role-escalations

# role-escalations

## Requirements

### Requirement: The implementer and verifier leave declared protected paths out of ESCALATIONS
The system prompt of every implementer and verifier run SHALL say that a protected path the sub-ticket declares is not an escalation, that the code reviewer lists declared paths once for each head it reviews, that the role may name them but not under ESCALATIONS, and that a protected path the sub-ticket does not declare still goes under ESCALATIONS.

#### Scenario: Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the fixture file written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

```sh
cat > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh <<'EOF'
# Sourced from the repo root of the checkout under test. Defines `prompt <role>`: starts one run of

- THEN it prints exactly `implementer declared=1 notunder=1 undeclared=1`, then `verifier declared=1 notunder=1 undeclared=1`

### Requirement: Every role still escalates an undeclared protected path, and the code reviewer still lists declared ones
The system prompts of implementer, code reviewer and verifier runs MUST still carry the preamble's rule to escalate a protected path that the approved spec's Risk section does not declare, and the code reviewer's prompt MUST still carry check 6 unchanged.

#### Scenario: All three run prompts keep the undeclared-path rule and the reviewer keeps check 6
Needs the GIVEN block of "Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh && u="a protected path the approved spec's Risk section does not declare"; for r in implementer reviewer verifier; do echo "$r undeclared=$(prompt $r | grep -cF "$u")"; done; echo "check6=$(prompt reviewer | grep -cF '6. Protected paths touched? If the sub-ticket does not declare them, ESCALATE. If it does, list them under ESCALATIONS')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer undeclared=1`, `reviewer undeclared=1`, `verifier undeclared=1`, `check6=1`, one per line

## Current truth: role-inputs

# role-inputs

## Requirements

### Requirement: The spec writer and critic receive in full only the capabilities their ticket names or their spec cites, and a capability index for the rest
When a ticket's latest finished triage output has a `Capabilities:` line, the spec writer and critic inputs SHALL hold in full only the current-truth capabilities that line names or the spec they work from cites by its `specs/<name>/spec.md` path. They MUST hold, for every other capability, one index line with its absolute spec path and its requirement names, under an instruction that citing a capability's path sends it in full to the critic. The planner SHALL receive no current truth.

#### Scenario: A ticket naming one capability composes inputs with only that capability in full and an index line for each other one
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the fixture file written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

The writer gets beta, which triage named. The critic also gets gamma, whose path the spec cites. A capability's index line holds both its spec's absolute path and its requirement name. The writer's and critic's capability index carries its instruction paragraph once; the planner has no capability index.

### Requirement: The spec writer, critic and planner receive in full only the decisions of their ticket and its capabilities, and a decision index for the rest
When a ticket's latest finished triage output has a `Capabilities:` line, the spec writer, critic and planner inputs SHALL hold in full only the decision-log lines logged against that ticket or naming a capability that role receives in full. They MUST hold one index line per ticket whose lines were left out, and the absolute path of `decisions.md` in an instruction to read a ticket's decisions with `grep`.

#### Scenario: Decisions of other tickets and capabilities reach each role as one index line per ticket
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ticket naming one capability composes inputs with only that capability in full and an index line for each other one" run once.

Each role's decision index carries its `grep` instruction once, with the log's absolute path.

### Requirement: A ticket whose triage output names no capabilities receives today's inputs
When a ticket's latest finished triage output has no `Capabilities:` line, the spec writer and critic SHALL receive every current-truth capability in full, and all three roles SHALL receive the whole decision log, as before this change.

#### Scenario: Without a Capabilities line every capability and every decision reach the writer, critic and planner
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ticket naming one capability composes inputs with only that capability in full and an index line for each other one" run once.

#### Scenario: The harness suite passes with the new inputs
- WHEN `(export HOME="$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P)"; uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "suite=$?")`
- THEN it prints exactly `suite=0`

### Requirement: Triage receives the capability index and is asked to name the capabilities a request touches
A triage run's input SHALL hold one capability index line per current-truth capability, with its absolute spec path and its requirement names, and no capability body or decision. Its system prompt MUST ask for a `Capabilities:` output line.

#### Scenario: A triage input lists every capability by path and requirement, and its prompt asks for the Capabilities line
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ticket naming one capability composes inputs with only that capability in full and an index line for each other one" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0036-store.sh 'Capabilities: beta'; f=$I; y() { grep -F -- "$S/openspec/specs/$1/spec.md" $f | grep -qF -- "The $1 part works" && echo y || echo n; }; echo "triage: alpha-index=$(y alpha) beta-index=$(y beta) gamma-index=$(y gamma) bodies=$(grep -c -- '-BODY' $f) decisions=$(grep -c -- '-LINE' $f) asks=$(grep -c '^Capabilities:' $(dirname $f)/system-prompt.txt)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `triage: alpha-index=y beta-index=y gamma-index=y bodies=0 decisions=0 asks=1`

## Current truth: store-setup

# store-setup

## Requirements

### Requirement: Run records are exempt from whitespace checks
A store that `init` or `run start` has touched MUST hold a `.gitattributes` with the line `runs/** -whitespace`, so that `git diff --check` SHALL NOT report run records while it still reports every other store file.

#### Scenario: Run records in a store pass whitespace checks and other store files do not
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && git init -q -b main $T/r && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && FACTORY_STATE=$T/r/store bin/factory init >/dev/null && git -C $T/r add -A && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q -m store && mkdir -p $T/r/store/runs/run-0001-verifier && printf 'context \n x\n' > $T/r/store/runs/run-0001-verifier/diff.patch && git -C $T/r add -A && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q -m record && git -C $T/r diff --check HEAD~1 HEAD >/dev/null; echo "runs=$?"; printf 'x \n' > $T/r/store/notes.md && git -C $T/r add -A && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q -m notes && git -C $T/r diff --check HEAD~1 HEAD >/dev/null; echo "other=$?")`
- THEN it prints `runs=0`, then `other=2`

#### Scenario: A run start adds the whitespace rule to an existing store
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && bin/factory run start --role planner --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null && echo "rule=$(cat $FACTORY_STATE/.gitattributes 2>/dev/null | grep -cxF 'runs/** -whitespace')")`
- THEN it prints `rule=1`

### Requirement: No half instance, and a missing briefing refuses
`factory init` MUST refuse with exit 2, writing nothing, when it would create an instance while `FACTORY_STATE` names another store; `run compose` MUST refuse with exit 2, writing no input, when the instance has no `context.md`.

#### Scenario: init refuses to create an instance on a throwaway store and writes nothing
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && FACTORY_STATE=$T/s $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? instance=$([ -e $T/tgt/.factory ] && echo written || echo none) store=$([ -e $T/s ] && echo written || echo none) names_state=$(grep -c FACTORY_STATE $T/err)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 instance=none store=none names_state=1`

#### Scenario: A missing briefing refuses the compose with exit 2
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && rm .factory/context.md && export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md && $B ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null && $B run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null && $B run compose run-0001-triage >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? input=$([ -e $T/s/runs/run-0001-triage/input.md ] && echo written || echo none) names_context=$(grep -c 'context.md' $T/err)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 input=none names_context=1`

### Requirement: Relative environment paths resolve from the caller's directory
A relative `FACTORY_STATE`, `FACTORY_INSTANCE` or `FACTORY_REPO` MUST resolve against the directory the command was run from; an absolute value SHALL be used as given.

#### Scenario: Relative FACTORY_STATE, FACTORY_INSTANCE and FACTORY_REPO resolve against the caller's directory
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; F=$(cd tests/factory/fixtures/instance && pwd -P); s=$(cd $T && FACTORY_INSTANCE=$F FACTORY_STATE=rel/store $B paths | tail -1); i=$(cd $F/.. && FACTORY_INSTANCE=instance $B paths | tail -1); r=$(cd $T && FACTORY_INSTANCE=$F FACTORY_REPO=rel $B paths | tail -1); echo "state=$(echo "$s" | grep -cF "\"state\": \"$T/rel/store\"") instance=$(echo "$i" | grep -cF "\"instance\": \"$F\"") repo=$(echo "$r" | grep -cF "\"state\": \"$T/rel/.factory/state\"")")`
- THEN it prints `state=1 instance=1 repo=1`

#### Scenario: An absolute FACTORY_STATE is used as given
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; F=$(cd tests/factory/fixtures/instance && pwd -P); cd / && echo "absolute=$(FACTORY_INSTANCE=$F FACTORY_STATE=$T/abs $B paths | tail -1 | grep -cF "\"state\": \"$T/abs\"")")`
- THEN it prints `absolute=1`

### Requirement: A new instance's store is a checkout of its own branch
`factory init` SHALL create a missing own store as a git worktree of branch `factory-store`, which the integration checkout does not see. It SHALL check that branch out when it already exists locally or on exactly one remote, so that a store commit never moves the integration branch.

#### Scenario: init creates the store on the factory-store branch, out of the integration checkout's sight
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "branch=$(git -C .factory/state symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>/dev/null) seen_by_main=$(git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all | grep -c '^?? .factory/state/')")`
- THEN it prints `branch=factory-store seen_by_main=0`

#### Scenario: init on a clone restores the store from the pushed branch
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); B=$PWD/bin/factory; export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=f GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=f@x GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=f GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=f@x; git init -q -b main $T/src && cd $T/src && git commit -q --allow-empty -m init && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && git add -A && git commit -q -m instance && git -C .factory/state add -A && git -C .factory/state commit -q -m "store: first" && git clone -q $T/src $T/c && cd $T/c && rm -rf .factory/state && $B init >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$? branch=$(git -C .factory/state symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>/dev/null) restored=$(ls .factory/state/decisions.md 2>/dev/null | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=0 branch=factory-store restored=1`

### Requirement: init refuses when more than one remote carries the store branch
`factory init` MUST refuse with exit 2, creating no store and no local branch, when the own store is missing, no local `factory-store` exists and more than one remote carries it; the refusal MUST name each `<remote>/factory-store`.

#### Scenario: init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both
- GIVEN the three fixture files written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown. Every later scenario of this change that names them reuses them.

- THEN it prints `exit=2 store=none local_branch=0 names=1,1`

### Requirement: init refuses to run from inside the store checkout
`factory init`, run with `FACTORY_INSTANCE` unset from a directory whose git top level is a checkout of `factory-store`, or is the store of the instance found from that directory or a checkout of the same repository inside that store, MUST refuse with exit 2 and write nothing, whichever commit the store has checked out, so that it never creates an instance inside the live store; other commands run from there SHALL still find the live instance, and `init` in a separate repository under the store SHALL still create that repository's instance.

#### Scenario: init from a scratch directory inside the store checkout refuses and leaves the store unchanged
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-b1.sh && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T25/r.md && $B ticket new --file $T25/r.md >/dev/null && $B run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1 && git -C .factory/state status --porcelain --untracked-files=all > $T25/before && cd .factory/state/runs/run-0001-triage/scratch && $B init --repo-name x >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$? phantom=$([ -e $T25/tgt/.factory/state/.factory ] && echo written || echo none) store=$(git -C $T25/tgt/.factory/state status --porcelain --untracked-files=all | cmp -s $T25/before - && echo unchanged || echo changed)"; echo "found=$($B ticket show T-0001 2>/dev/null | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 phantom=none store=unchanged`, then `found=ready-for-triage`

#### Scenario: init from the store checkout on a detached HEAD refuses
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-b1.sh && git -C .factory/state add -A && git -C .factory/state commit -q -m "store: first" && git -C .factory/state checkout -q --detach && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T25/r.md && $B ticket new --file $T25/r.md >/dev/null && $B run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1 && git -C .factory/state status --porcelain --untracked-files=all > $T25/before && cd .factory/state/runs/run-0001-triage/scratch && $B init --repo-name x >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$? detached=$(git -C $T25/tgt/.factory/state symbolic-ref -q HEAD >/dev/null && echo no || echo yes) phantom=$([ -e $T25/tgt/.factory/state/.factory ] && echo written || echo none) store=$(git -C $T25/tgt/.factory/state status --porcelain --untracked-files=all | cmp -s $T25/before - && echo unchanged || echo changed)"; echo "found=$($B ticket show T-0001 2>/dev/null | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 detached=yes phantom=none store=unchanged`, then `found=ready-for-triage`

#### Scenario: init in a separate repository under a run's scratch directory still creates its instance
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-b1.sh && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T25/r.md && $B ticket new --file $T25/r.md >/dev/null && $B run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1 && cd .factory/state/runs/run-0001-triage/scratch && git init -q -b main other && cd other && git commit -q --allow-empty -m init && $B init --repo-name other >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$? instance=$([ -f .factory/instance.yaml ] && echo written || echo none) live=$(cd $T25/tgt && $B ticket show T-0001 2>/dev/null | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints `exit=0 instance=written live=ready-for-triage`

### Requirement: init refuses a store path the integration branch has tracked
`factory init` MUST refuse with exit 2, writing nothing and naming the path, when it would create the own store at a path under which the integration branch has ever tracked a file.

#### Scenario: init refuses a once-tracked store path and writes nothing
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); B=$PWD/bin/factory; export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=f GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=f@x GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=f GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=f@x; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && cd $T/tgt && mkdir -p .factory/state && echo old > .factory/state/old.md && git add -A && git commit -q -m "old store" && git rm -q -r .factory/state && git commit -q -m "store removed" && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? instance=$([ -e .factory ] && echo written || echo none) names_path=$(grep -q '\.factory/state' $T/err && echo 1 || echo 0)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 instance=none names_path=1`

### Requirement: store migrate moves a tracked store onto its branch and keeps every record
`factory store migrate --to PATH` on an idle, fully committed own store that is tracked on the integration branch SHALL do all of the following:
- put the store's last committed tree on a new `factory-store` branch, checked out at PATH;
- copy the store's ignored run files to PATH, and verify the copy before removing anything;
- untrack and remove the old path;
- set `state_dir` to PATH, so that later commands use the moved store.

#### Scenario: store migrate carries the store to factory-store at the new path
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-old.sh && mkdir -p .factory/state/runs/run-0001-triage/scratch && echo n > .factory/state/runs/run-0001-triage/scratch/n.txt && $B store migrate --to .factory/store >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$?"; echo "branch=$(git -C .factory/store symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>/dev/null) same_tree=$([ "$(git rev-parse -q --verify 'factory-store^{tree}')" = "$(git rev-parse $PRE:.factory/state)" ] && echo yes || echo no) scratch=$(cat .factory/store/runs/run-0001-triage/scratch/n.txt 2>/dev/null) old=$([ -e .factory/state ] && echo kept || echo gone) main_tracks=$(git ls-files .factory/state | grep -c .) seen_by_main=$(git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all | grep -c '^?? .factory/store/')"; echo "state_dir=$(sed -n 's/^state_dir: *//p' .factory/instance.yaml) ticket=$($B ticket show T-0001 2>/dev/null | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints `exit=0`, then `branch=factory-store same_tree=yes scratch=n old=gone main_tracks=0 seen_by_main=0`, then `state_dir=.factory/store ticket=ready-for-triage`

### Requirement: store migrate refuses while the store is in use or uncommitted
`factory store migrate` MUST refuse with exit 2, creating no branch and no new path, when a store file is uncommitted or a run is in flight. The refusal MUST name the uncommitted files or the runs in flight.

#### Scenario: store migrate refuses an uncommitted store and a run in flight
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-old.sh && echo edit >> .factory/state/decisions.md; $B store migrate --to .factory/store >/dev/null 2>$T25/e1; echo "uncommitted: exit=$? names=$(grep -c 'decisions.md' $T25/e1) branch=$(git branch --list factory-store | grep -c .)"; git checkout -q -- .factory/state/decisions.md && $B run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1 && git add -A && git commit -q -m "run started"; FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 $B store migrate --to .factory/store >/dev/null 2>$T25/e2; echo "in flight: exit=$? names=$(grep -c 'run-0001-triage' $T25/e2) branch=$(git branch --list factory-store | grep -c .) new=$([ -e .factory/store ] && echo written || echo none)")`
- THEN it prints `uncommitted: exit=2 names=1 branch=0`, then `in flight: exit=2 names=1 branch=0 new=none`

### Requirement: A checkout of an older commit leaves a moved store untouched
After `store migrate`, checking out a commit from before the move in the integration checkout, and then checking out the integration branch again, MUST leave every file of the moved store as it was, uncommitted ones included.

#### Scenario: A checkout of an older commit leaves the moved store untouched
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-old.sh && $B store migrate --to .factory/store >/dev/null 2>&1 && git commit -q -a -m "store moved to its branch"; (echo live > .factory/store/live.md) 2>/dev/null; git checkout -q $PRE 2>/dev/null && git checkout -q main 2>/dev/null; echo "live=$(cat .factory/store/live.md 2>/dev/null || echo lost) on=$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)")`
- THEN it prints `live=live on=main`

## Current truth: sub-ticket-planning

# sub-ticket-planning

## Requirements

### Requirement: A later plan's sub-tickets continue the parent's numbering
`factory subticket add` on a parent that already has sub-tickets MUST number the new ones from the next free index, SHALL accept a `Depends on:` line naming an existing sub-ticket, and MUST refuse a plan whose head line reuses an existing sub-ticket's id, writing nothing.

#### Scenario: A later plan's sub-tickets take the next free ids and may depend on a merged sibling
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-closed.sh && printf 'ST-1 / Fix the bypass\nDepends on: T-0001.2\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan2.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan2.md 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | grep -o '"id": "[^"]*"\|"depends_on": \[[^]]*\]'; bin/factory ticket ready-implementers T-0001 | tail -1 | grep -o '"ready": \[[^]]*\]')`
- THEN it prints `"id": "T-0001.3"`, then `"depends_on": ["T-0001.2"]`, then `"ready": ["T-0001.3"]`

#### Scenario: A plan that reuses an existing sub-ticket id is refused and writes nothing
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-closed.sh && printf 'T-0001.1 / Again\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan3.md; bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan3.md >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$? $(ls $FACTORY_STATE/tickets | tr '\n' ' ')")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 T-0001.1.yaml T-0001.2.yaml T-0001.yaml `

### Requirement: A spec that needs one sub-ticket becomes that sub-ticket without a planner run
`factory plan whole-spec <parent>`, on a parent at `ready-for-planner` with an approved spec, MUST act when four conditions hold: the parent has no sub-ticket; it has no earlier planner run; its latest spec-writer run did not end NEEDS-SPLIT; and its approved spec has no `##` or `###` heading, other than a requirement line, naming seams. It MUST then create one sub-ticket `<parent>.1`, ready for its implementer, whose text names every scenario of the approved spec. It MUST log `plan.skipped` with the reason, and report `"planner": "skipped"`. Otherwise it SHALL report `"planner": "needed"` with the reason and write nothing.

#### Scenario: A spec that needs one sub-ticket becomes that sub-ticket without a planner run
- GIVEN the fixture file written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

```sh

#### Scenario: A spec the writer split, or a parent a planner already ran on, still goes to the planner and nothing is written
Needs the GIVEN block of "A spec that needs one sub-ticket becomes that sub-ticket without a planner run" run once. The three cases are a NEEDS-SPLIT spec, a spec with a `### Size and seams` heading, and a parent with an earlier planner run.
- WHEN `(for c in 'NEEDS-SPLIT|' 'READY-FOR-CRITIC|### Size and seams' 'READY-FOR-CRITIC|planner-ran'; do (s=${c%%|*}; x=${c#*|}; [ "$x" = planner-ran ] && e='' || e=$x; . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-plan.sh $s "$e" && if [ "$x" = planner-ran ]; then P=$($B run start --role planner --ticket T-0001 | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'); $B run finish $P --status-override ESCALATE >/dev/null; fi; $B plan whole-spec T-0001 > $T/o 2>&1; echo "exit=$? planner=$(tail -1 $T/o | sed -n 's/.*"planner": "\([a-z]*\)".*/\1/p') subs=$(ls $T/store/tickets | tr '\n' ' ')logged=$($B log tail --event plan.skipped | grep -c .)"); done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `exit=0 planner=needed subs=T-0001.yaml logged=0`, three times

### Requirement: The whole-spec step refuses where a planner run would
`factory plan whole-spec` MUST refuse with exit 2, writing nothing, on a parent that is not at `ready-for-planner`, has a run in flight, or has no approved spec. A refusal for the wrong state SHALL name the state with `not ready-for-planner`.

#### Scenario: The whole-spec step refuses a parent that is not ready for its planner
Needs the GIVEN block of "A spec that needs one sub-ticket becomes that sub-ticket without a planner run" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-plan.sh READY-FOR-CRITIC '' && $B ticket transition T-0001 --to planned --by t >/dev/null && $B plan whole-spec T-0001 >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? named=$(grep -c 'not ready-for-planner' $T/err) subs=$(ls $T/store/tickets | tr '\n' ' ')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `exit=2 named=1 subs=T-0001.yaml `

## Decision log (decisions.md): standing decisions, read-only

2026-10-04 T-0023 `resolve --ruling F` also accepts a park whose reason starts with `BLOCKED`. It writes F as the next `approvals/<id>/ruling-<n>.md` and returns the sub-ticket to `ready-for-implementer` at the same round.
2026-10-04 T-0023 `resolve PARENT --replan F` moves a parked parent whose sub-tickets have all merged to `ready-for-planner`, with F as its next ruling. The planner receives F and plans the fix. Rejected: the requester's `--replan --file <plan>` straight to `planned`. It needs a new routing edge, which the queue policy does not count as small. It would also skip the planner. `dev/build-harness.spec.md` already sends a re-plan through the planner.
2026-10-04 T-0023 On a re-plan, the planner's input lists the parent's existing sub-tickets, each with its title and state. The human's note F therefore needs to say only what to fix. Rejected: asking the human to restate in F what has merged, which the store already knows.
2026-10-04 T-0023 Sub-tickets that a later plan adds take the next free ids under the parent, and their `Depends on:` lines may name the parent's existing sub-tickets. A plan head line that reuses an existing sub-ticket's id is refused. Rejected: honouring explicit non-colliding ids, a second numbering rule that the planner's free-form ids would make ambiguous.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A park reason is never blank. When the clerk relays an empty stderr, the workflows use the refusal's JSON `error`, and failing that `exit <n>, no JSON on stdout` or `exit <n>, no error text`. Rejected: editing each of the 26 reason sites.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A redispatch sets aside a checker's rows only when they did not pass. The reviewer's row is kept when it is `APPROVE`. The verifier and gate rows are kept together when they are `VERIFIED` and `PASS`, because one verifier run writes both. The build then runs only the checkers with no row on that commit. After an implementer run it still runs both. Rejected: a `--roles` flag on redispatch, which no reported case needs.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The store gets a `.gitattributes` holding `runs/** -whitespace`. `init` and every `run start` write it the way they already write `.gitignore`. Rejected: rewriting committed records, and excluding the store path inside each gate command.
2026-10-04 T-0023 `init` refuses, with exit 2 and nothing written, to create an instance while `FACTORY_STATE` names another store. A compose with no `context.md` refuses with exit 2. Rejected: writing every instance piece from a throwaway-store `init`. That contradicts the rule that such a run initialises only that store.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A relative `FACTORY_INSTANCE`, `FACTORY_STATE` or `FACTORY_REPO` resolves against the caller's directory: `FACTORY_CWD`, else the working directory.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The suite's own-store cases that are not about the uncommitted-edit refusal run the CLI through a test-only launcher that stubs that one check. The refusal itself keeps its tests on a clone's real `bin/factory`. Rejected: a switch the production CLI honours, which would loosen the check. Also rejected: running every case from a committed snapshot of the working tree, which changes every assertion that names this checkout's revision or paths.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The suite scenario gives pytest a fresh temporary directory under `/tmp` and removes it afterwards. Four existing tests need a temporary directory outside every repository, and an agent's scratch directory lies inside this one. The scenario states this in its command, so no role has to choose between its scratch rule and a valid run. Rejected: fixing those four tests in this ticket, which is beyond H8 and needs its own design (Out-of-scope observations).
2026-10-04 T-0023 The workflow-script fixes are checked by acceptance scenarios that run the scripts under node with a stub clerk. They get no suite test, because the suite does not need node today and adding that would change what the gate needs.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The change is built as four seams (design.md, "Size and seams"). They share one changelog entry, 51.
2026-10-04 T-0024 T-0024: instance B keeps the spec store created 2026-10-04 by run-0196; its tickets close by archive into current truth (operator)
2026-10-04 T-0024 While a role run is in flight on a live store, a human or runner writes it by prefixing that one command with FACTORY_DISPATCH=1; README documents it and the refusal text never names it (operator)
2026-10-04 T-0024 Instance B keeps the spec store that run-0196 created. Its tickets close by archive into current truth, and `decisions.md` keeps reaching the spec writer, critic and planner. The operator decided this in the first answer to this ticket, and it is already recorded in `decisions.md`. This is a standing decision. This ticket touches README, so it also corrects README's stale "never entered it" line, as that answer directs.
2026-10-04 T-0024 While a role run is in flight on a live store, the operator or a runner session writes it by putting `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` in front of that one command. README documents this. The refusal text never names the marker. The operator decided this in the same answer, and it is already recorded in `decisions.md`. This is a standing decision for every runner session, including the Driver session that runs the Nanobot fork's instance (instance A).
2026-10-04 T-0024 A write is refused, marker or not and run in flight or not, when the caller's directory lies under the own store's `runs/` or `worktrees/`. The operator's gate review asked for this rule. Rejected: applying it only while a run is in flight, because a process a role left running in its run directory would then write freely once the store went idle. Rejected: letting the marker lift it, because the rule exists so that a copied or exported marker does not help from there. This is a standing decision: the operator and runner sessions run store writes from outside the store.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The location rule is checked first, then the marker, then the in-flight list.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The in-flight rule acts only on an instance's own store, and only while at least one run is in flight on any ticket of that store. Rejected: refusing every unmarked write at all times, as the requester proposed. The operator would then need the marker on every command and would export it in the shell, and every role run started from that shell would inherit it. The operator's decision on the marker assumes unmarked writes when nothing is in flight.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The in-flight rule checks every ticket's in-flight list, not only the calling ticket's. The tool cannot tell which run, if any, is calling.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The marker is the environment variable `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1`. Both workflow scripts put it in front of every clerk command. Rejected: the requester's exemption for "a human's `--by`". Human commands have no `--by`, and `ticket transition` requires one from everyone.
2026-10-04 T-0024 A write is every command except a fixed read-only list: `ticket show`, `ticket join`, `results show`, `config`, `status parse`, `log tail` and `paths`. Any command given `--accept-harness` is a write, because it rewrites the lock and logs. A new command is fenced until someone adds it to the list. Rejected: the requester's list of ten write commands. It misses writes such as `ticket set`, `ticket park`, `ticket head`, `ticket ready-implementers`, `ticket parent-check`, `run compose` and `spec add`.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The refusal exits 2 and writes nothing. Its text is `role runs may not write the live store (<detail>); use a throwaway FACTORY_STATE`. The detail is `<store>; in flight: <run ids>` for the in-flight rule and `<store>; called from inside its runs/` (or `worktrees/`) for the location rule. The advice is meant for a role. The operator learns the marker from README.
2026-10-04 T-0024 A run left in flight by a dead workflow keeps the in-flight rule up. The operator clears it with a marked `run finish <run> --status-override KILLED`, run from the repository root, and README says so. Rejected: a timeout that drops the fence by itself. A long run that is still working would lose the fence.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The fence guards against accidents, not against a determined agent. It is not a security boundary. A role working from outside the store that copies the marker from the workflow scripts or README still gets through. That is recorded under Risk rather than designed around. Isolating role runs at the operating-system level is issue #37.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The fence is checked before the harness lock, the check that each instance runs only the harness revision it has accepted. A fenced command is refused before it reaches the lock, so a fenced `--accept-harness` rewrites nothing. A marked command still meets the lock and its uncommitted-edit refusal unchanged, so the marker cannot be used to get past the lock. Rejected: checking the fence after the lock, because `--accept-harness` rewrites the lock inside that check, so a fenced acceptance would write before it was refused.
2026-10-04 T-0024 Part B (a preamble line) is cut. The incident came from the test suite, not from a command the role typed, so a preamble line would not have stopped it. The refusal text gives the same advice at the moment it matters.
2026-10-04 T-0024 Part C (the tripwire on the store root) is cut. Role runs legitimately write their own run directory in the store (`output.md`, `scratch/`). Clerk commands for other tickets' runs also write the store during a run. A comparison of the store root therefore cannot tell whose write it saw. The fence refuses the write before it happens.
2026-10-04 T-0022 Removing clearly redundant work (a step, run or check that cannot change any outcome) is pre-approved, provided every refusal the pipeline gives today still fires (operator, 2026-10-04: 'slashing clearly redundant work is always going to be OK, if we trust our process')
2026-10-04 T-0022 Under a sub-ticket's Tests to change, the planner may list tests an earlier sibling of the same parent added, with a harness check that each first appeared in a sibling's merge; pre-existing tests still need the approved spec (operator, #40)
2026-10-04 T-0025 The store lives on its own branch, `factory-store`, checked out as a git worktree at the store's path (B1). This is for the operator to confirm at the spec gate. Rejected: B2, the branch written through git plumbing with no working copy. It needs new harness commands to snapshot, show and restore the store, and `git clean -fdx` in the integration checkout deletes the store (Evidence). Rejected: A, a gate exception (operator, 2026-10-04).
2026-10-04 T-0025 A store path must be one the integration branch has never tracked. Both existing stores move from `.factory/state` to `.factory/store`. Rejected: keeping `.factory/state`, where checking out an older commit overwrote an uncommitted record and checking `main` out again deleted it (Evidence).
2026-10-04 T-0025 The branch is named `factory-store`, and the design doc and build spec drop the name `tickets` for it. Rejected: `tickets`, a generic name in a target repo whose branches serve other work, such as the Nanobot repo, which shares its objects with another checkout.
2026-10-04 T-0025 `init` creates a new store as a worktree on an unborn `factory-store` branch, and the operator makes the first commit. On a clone where the branch already exists, `init` checks it out, which restores the store. Rejected: `init` committing, which needs a git identity, and the suite runs under a throwaway HOME that has none.
2026-10-04 T-0025 When no local `factory-store` exists and more than one remote carries it, `init` refuses and names each `<remote>/factory-store`. The operator picks one with `git branch factory-store <remote>/factory-store` and runs `init` again. Rejected: creating a new empty branch, which would silently start a second store history beside the pushed one. Also rejected: preferring `origin`, a guess about which remote is canonical.
2026-10-04 T-0025 With `FACTORY_INSTANCE` unset, `init` refuses, writing nothing, when the caller's git top level is a checkout of `factory-store`. It also refuses when the instance found by walking up from the caller's directory has a store that is that top level, or that contains it in the same repository (the same git common directory). These are the cases where it would build a phantom instance inside the live store. The second condition does not depend on which branch or commit the store has checked out, so a detached store HEAD does not open the route again (operator, round 2 change request N2). The same-repository qualifier keeps `init` working in a separate throwaway repository under a run's scratch directory (Evidence). Rejected: "contains" without that qualifier, which would refuse every suite `init` run with pytest's temporary directory inside a store. Rejected: taking the repository from the parent of `--git-common-dir`. That is the main worktree, which for the Nanobot instance is `~/dev/nanobot`, another checkout on another branch, and for the runtime checkout is `~/dev/spec-factory` (Evidence).
2026-10-04 T-0025 In `init`, every refusal and the store-worktree step come before any instance file is written, so a failed worktree step (for example, git's "already used by worktree" when `init` runs in a code checkout of a repo whose store branch is checked out elsewhere) leaves nothing behind.
2026-10-04 T-0025 The integration checkout ignores the store through the repo's git exclude file, which `init` and `store migrate` write. Rejected: a line in the target's tracked `.gitignore`. That would change the target's code to record a fact about one clone.
2026-10-04 T-0025 A new command, `factory store migrate --to PATH`, moves an existing store. It refuses unless the store is idle and committed, and it leaves the integration-branch side uncommitted for the operator to review. Rejected: a hand procedure, untested, run once on each repo by a different session.
2026-10-04 T-0025 `store migrate` deletes the old store directory only after it has checked that every ignored file (run scratch directories, tripwire baselines) was copied byte for byte. If the check fails, it undoes its own worktree and branch and leaves the old store as it was. Rejected: relying on `git status` in the new checkout, which cannot see ignored files.
2026-10-04 T-0025 The store branch starts with one commit whose tree is the store as last committed on the integration branch, and whose message names that commit. Earlier history stays readable with `git log <that commit> -- .factory/state`. Rejected: rewriting history with a subtree split. It would follow only part of the store's past, which began at `intake/state`, and it adds nothing that `main`'s history does not already keep.
2026-10-04 T-0025 An instance whose store is still a plain directory keeps working unchanged. `init` leaves such a store alone and points to `store migrate`. The harness reads and writes the store only through `state_dir`, so it runs with either layout.
2026-10-04 T-0022 A sub-ticket's "Tests to change" may list a test file that an earlier sibling of the same parent added, one line each: `` `<file>[::<test>]` (added by <sibling ID>): <reason> ``. The harness reads only lines of that form inside the "Tests to change" field, and checks the file, not the test function. Rejected: checking test functions. The implementer rule puts new tests in new files, so a file is what a sibling adds, and git records files.
2026-10-04 T-0022 A listed file counts as added by a sibling when it is absent at the parent's `parent_base`, and the first commit since then on the integration branch that added it lies inside one merged sibling's recorded merge (reachable from its `main_after`, not from its `base_before`). Any merged sibling of the parent counts, including those from an earlier plan. The sibling ID on the line is for the reader and is not matched. Rejected: matching the named ID, because the planner's IDs (`ST-1`) differ from the store's (`T-0001.1`) and the operator's rule names no particular sibling.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The check runs in `run start` for every implementer run of a sub-ticket: first dispatch, fix rounds and catch-up runs. Every dispatch passes through that one place. Rejected: checking when the plan is added, when no sibling has merged yet. Rejected: checking at the merge gate, after the implementer has already edited the test. Rejected: checking where a waiting sub-ticket is released, which happens in two places and never for a sub-ticket with no dependencies.
2026-10-04 T-0022 A failed check refuses the run start with exit 2, writes nothing, and gives an error that starts `BLOCKED from harness:` and names the file. The build workflow parks the sub-ticket with that error as the reason, so `resolve --ruling` handles it like an implementer's BLOCKED. That is what the operator's "parks for the operator, as today" describes. Rejected: a new kind of park with its own resolve verb. Rejected: having `run start` park the ticket itself, which would break the rule that a refusal writes nothing.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The preamble's guardrail sentence and the code reviewer's test-integrity check also accept a sibling entry that the harness has checked. Without them, the implementer and reviewer would still treat the edit as forbidden, and the park would remain.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The earlier sibling names the tests a later sibling will break under a new planner field, "Interim tests". The harness does not read it.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The critic's check for an omitted test goes under rubric 1 (Grounded), where the requester asked for it.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The requester's acceptance, a re-plan and re-spec of Nanobot T-0002 that the operator compares side by side, is an Operator step, not an acceptance scenario. Running it needs the Nanobot store and real agents, which a verifier must not touch.
2026-10-04 T-0032 Empty role output (#41, T-0032): labelled EMPTY-OUTPUT with the last message, re-dispatched once automatically, parked on a second; the code reviewer judges the diff and leaves the test suite and gates to the verifier.
2026-10-04 T-0029 Only the code reviewer lists declared protected paths, once for each head it reviews. The implementer and verifier may name them in their output, but not under ESCALATIONS. This is a standing decision: a later prompt change should not give another role a declared-path notice. The operator pre-approved it on 2026-10-04 (`.factory/answers/operator-decisions-2026-10-04.md`), under the standing decision that removing clearly redundant work is allowed when every refusal still fires.
2026-10-04 T-0029 A fix round makes a new head, so it gets its own reviewer notice, as today. Rejected: one notice per sub-ticket. A fix round can change a declared path again, and the operator would not hear about it.
2026-10-04 T-0029 The new rule also keeps one escalation for a declared path: when the change does something to it that the spec does not describe. An undeclared path still escalates as well. Rejected: the retro's wording "the reviewer lists declared paths for the merge gate". No local merge check reads the declaration, so that sentence would teach the roles something false.
2026-10-04 T-0029 The implementer and verifier get the same bullet word for word, as the last bullet under RULES. That way one text is checked in both prompts.
2026-10-04 T-0029 The changelog records the count re-derived from the store log (10 runs, 30 of 205 items). Rejected: the retro's 26 of 139, which its own table contradicts with 38.
2026-10-04 T-0029 Acceptance checks the composed run prompts and the document copies. The request's own check (on the next build, one notice per head, from the reviewer) is kept as an operator step. Rejected: an acceptance item that waits for a real build. The verifier cannot run one, and how a model follows a prompt rule is not something a check on one commit can prove.
2026-10-05 T-0028 Part A overturns the cut in T-0016's spec. The path-scoped gate skip is built as the operator pre-approved it, with no repository's configuration changed. Rejected: cutting it again because it would have skipped almost no past run. The request expects a small saving here and still asks for the mechanism. Part A is a separate part, so the operator can delete it and its scenarios at the gate.
2026-10-05 T-0028 A gate command's `paths` are git pathspecs. A command is skipped when `git diff --name-only <base>...<head> -- <paths>` lists no file. Include entries (`src/`) and exclude entries (`:(exclude)dev/`) both work. Rejected: a glob matcher of our own, a second matching rule that could disagree with git's. Standing: later tickets and instance configs use pathspec semantics.
2026-10-05 T-0028 If this repository's suite is ever scoped, its paths should exclude what it does not read rather than list what it does: `:(exclude)dev/` and `:(exclude)README.md`. Rejected: the requester's inclusion list, which leaves out `.gitignore` and any new top-level file, so it would skip the suite on changes that fail it.
2026-10-05 T-0028 The harness decides the skip when a reviewer or verifier run starts on a sub-ticket. It reads the live instance's configuration and that run's base and head. The verifier is told which commands are skipped, so it does not decide. Rejected: letting the verifier judge relevance, which no record could check.
2026-10-05 T-0028 Each skipped command is recorded twice: in the checker run's `meta.yaml` (`gate_skipped`) and on the `ci` row (`skipped`). Each entry has the command, `status: SKIPPED` and the reason. The row's PASS or FAIL still comes from the verifier's `Gate suite:` line, over the commands that ran.
2026-10-05 T-0028 A malformed gate entry refuses every implementer, reviewer and verifier run start with exit 2, before a run is created. A malformed entry is anything other than a string, or a mapping with a non-empty string `command` and an optional non-empty list of non-empty strings `paths`, with no other key. Rejected: treating a typo such as `path:` as unscoped. The operator would believe a scope is in force that is not.
2026-10-05 T-0028 An empty `paths` list is refused. Rejected: reading it as "covers nothing", which would skip the command on every diff.
2026-10-05 T-0028 The planner is skipped when all of these hold, and otherwise runs as today: the parent has no sub-ticket and no earlier planner run; its latest spec-writer run did not end NEEDS-SPLIT; and its approved spec has no `##` or `###` heading, other than a `### Requirement:` line, that contains the word seam or seams. This sorts all thirteen past parents as they were built (Evidence). Rejected: the requester's "exactly one lettered part", which would have skipped none of the nine. Rejected: NEEDS-SPLIT alone, which would have built T-0025's two parts, about 470 lines, as one sub-ticket. Standing: the planner runs only for a spec that is split, re-planned or already planned once.
2026-10-05 T-0028 To force the planner on a spec that meets every condition, the operator adds a `### Size and seams` heading in a gate edit (`approve-spec --edit`). No new flag.
2026-10-05 T-0028 The whole-spec sub-ticket is `<parent>.1`, at `ready-for-implementer`, with no dependency. Its text names every scenario of the approved spec, one `- <name>` line each. For everything else it points to the spec: every lettered part, the spec's labels, its Tests to change and its Risk list. Because it names every scenario, the parent closes on its VERIFIED run under the existing rule (part C).
2026-10-05 T-0028 The store records the skip three ways: a `plan.skipped` event in the log with its reason, the parent's plan file (`plans/<parent>.md`), and the change folder's `tasks.md` when the repository has a spec store. A planner-made plan writes the same two files.
2026-10-05 T-0028 A spec already applied on `main`, the planner's most frequent ESCALATE, is caught after the skip by the implementer's step 2 and by the verifier's base run of NEW checks (design part B, table). The catch costs an implementer run in place of a planner run. Rejected: a harness check of "already applied", which would need the agents' judgment of what the spec asks for.
2026-10-07 T-0032 Retry-once-then-park on a role's unusable output (#41's EMPTY-OUTPUT) is the general mechanism: later refusal kinds (#68 format, #67 spec-lint) register with it rather than adding their own. resolve --ruling should also accept a budget-kill or EMPTY-OUTPUT park (rulings had to be placed by hand on T-0029.1 and T-0028.1).
2026-10-07 T-0032 An empty output is `EMPTY-OUTPUT`, never a budget kill. That covers a missing or empty output file, an agent call that returns blank text, and one that returns `null` (a user skip or a terminal API error). Rejected: keeping a budget-kill path for some of these. The harness enforces no budget, and the agent call reports no reason (Evidence).
2026-10-07 T-0032 Standing, from the operator's answer, already in `decisions.md` as the 2026-10-04 T-0032 line, for both parts: the empty-output route, and the reviewer leaving the suite and the gate to the verifier. Later changes follow both.
2026-10-07 T-0032 `EMPTY-OUTPUT` is decided in one place, `run finish`. The workflows no longer send `--status-override KILLED` for an empty return, so `run finish` reads the output file for every run. Rejected: a second override value in the scripts. It would label a run empty even when its output file was written.
2026-10-07 T-0032 The retry is counted inside one workflow run: one re-dispatch, then a park. Rejected: a counter in the store. It would add a ticket field for a case that a human already watches, because a workflow that stops is restarted by hand.
2026-10-07 T-0032 A thrown agent call is not re-dispatched. It carries its own error text, including the error thrown when the turn's token ceiling is spent, so it is the one stop the harness can name.
2026-10-07 T-0032 The last message is kept by a new command, `factory run last-message RUN --text=…`, called only after `run finish` has returned `EMPTY-OUTPUT`. The text is the last 4000 characters, as one shell single-quoted word. Rejected: passing it on every `run finish`, which would put each role's whole output through every clerk command.
2026-10-07 T-0032 A second empty output parks as `EMPTY-OUTPUT from <role>`, in the same form as the other role parks, and lists both runs. The last messages stay in the run directories, not in the reason.
2026-10-07 T-0032 A checker's second empty output parks before any result row is recorded for it. `resolve --redispatch` then re-runs only that checker, because the other checker's passing rows stand. Rejected: an `EMPTY-OUTPUT` result row and a join rule for it, a new row status for the same outcome.
2026-10-07 T-0032 The reviewer's input no longer lists the gate commands. It says that the verifier runs them, as the design's routing table already declares (`docs/design.md:126`).
2026-10-07 T-0032 The `budget kill` join reason is kept for hand-recorded `KILLED` rows. Rejected: renaming it, which would change three existing tests for a case no one reported.
2026-10-07 T-0032 `build.js:137` (the implementer's `budget kill` park) is removed. `run finish` can no longer return `KILLED` to the workflow, so the line would never run.
2026-10-07 T-0033 Protected paths at merge (#57, T-0033): the pinned spec's Risk list is the authorization; an undeclared changed protected path is refused at merge and parks for a ruling; no per-head approval step. All instances.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The critic keeps its minimum check, at least 2 cited paths and 1 acceptance command per review. It gains a cap of at most 2 paths and 1 command for any one claim. Rejected: replacing the minimum with the cap, which would let a critic approve having checked nothing. `docs/principles.md`'s Spiking section states the bound per claim ("Grounding a claim … two paths, one command").
2026-10-08 T-0034 The critic runs no test suite and builds nothing (no clone, worktree or prototype of the change). It runs an acceptance command only as the spec gives it, and picks one that runs no test suite. Standing: a later change to the critic prompt keeps this rule, as principle 2 requires.
2026-10-08 T-0034 A claim the critic could settle only by running a test suite or building the change is a finding for the writer, or a question, and the critic says what it could not check. The finding's severity follows the existing rubric. Rubric item 2 ("NEW items fail today") stays unchanged.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The writer and the critic get the same three reading sentences: batch independent reads and commands, read a line range once grep has found it, and send long output to a scratch file and grep or tail it. Only the writer gets "write the spec in as few writes as you can". The critic writes one verdict and needs no such rule.
2026-10-08 T-0034 No shared preamble line. The rules go only in the two role prompts. Rejected: a preamble line, which would reach every role, including the implementer and verifier, which the request does not cover.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The rules are added as new lines only, so no existing line of either prompt changes. The writer's rule is the last RULES bullet of the documented copy. The critic's rules follow its existing PROCESS line.
2026-10-08 T-0034 `docs/principles.md` records the critic's new rule under principle 2 and corrects principle 2's status line, which says "reader roles run no suites" was done by #41 alone.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The request's acceptance, a replay of 2–3 approved intakes with old and new prompts, is an Operator step. Running it needs live model runs, and judging spec quality side by side is a human call. The scenarios check the text the roles receive.
2026-10-08 T-0035 This change overturns part of a standing decision, one that later tickets must keep, recorded on 2026-10-08 for T-0034, the ticket that applied #73: "The critic runs no test suite and builds nothing ... Standing: a later change to the critic prompt keeps this rule". The no-test-suite half stands. The no-build half and the per-claim cap (T-0034's other 2026-10-08 decision) are removed. Authority: the operator's choice in `.factory/answers/T-0034-acceptance-2026-10-08.md`. Standing: later changes to the critic prompt keep the no-suite rule and do not re-add a per-claim cap or a no-build rule without new evidence.
2026-10-08 T-0035 The critic prompt gains one sentence that allows a small experiment in its scratch directory to confirm a finding. Without it, the kept sentence "A claim you could settle only by ... building the change is a finding" reads as the old ban. The kept sentence still covers building or trying out the change itself, which the request's item C (its `docs/principles.md` change) leaves to the writer or to a spike, a ticket built only to test whether an approach works. Rejected: deleting the kept sentence. The triage role, which sorts a request before the spec writer sees it, asked to keep it, and it still tells the critic what to do with a claim it cannot check.
2026-10-08 T-0035 The no-suite line gains its reason, "the implementer and the verifier run it", as the request's item B (its list of what the critic keeps) gives. `Pick an acceptance command that runs no test suite, and run it as the spec gives it.` and the Turn economy paragraph stay word for word.
2026-10-08 T-0035 The Spiking section records the replay result, as the request's item C asks ("Record the replay result"). The changelog entry records it too.
2026-10-08 T-0035 Of the current-truth requirements that #73 added, four are restated (MODIFIED), because each states the rule being removed or forbids removing a critic line. Other current-truth requirements that check the diff of their own change (for example "The documents record the live-store guard", which expects no prompt copy to change) are left as they are, as #73 left them. Their scenarios describe their own change, not standing behaviour.
2026-10-08 T-0035 "Writer unchanged from #73" is checked as no difference from `05cf8f9` in either writer prompt file, plus the writer's design block equal to its `docs/prompts/` copy. Together these mean the design block is unchanged too.
2026-10-09 T-0036 Triage names the capabilities on a new output line, `Capabilities:`, chosen from a capability index added to its input. A token that names no current-truth capability, such as `none` or `new`, is ignored.
2026-10-09 T-0036 Which capabilities a role receives in full: the names on triage's line, plus each existing capability whose `specs/<name>/spec.md` path appears in the spec the role works from. For the writer that is its previous version on a revision round. For the critic it is the version under review. For the planner it is the approved version, read whole, Evidence included. A writer that opens a capability and cites its path under Evidence therefore hands it to the critic. This keeps the request's rule that the critic sees the writer's list plus whatever the writer opened.
2026-10-09 T-0036 A ticket whose latest finished triage output has no `Capabilities:` line gets today's inputs, the whole of current truth and the whole log. This covers tickets triaged before this change, T-0036 among them. Rejected: sending only the index in that case, which would cut those tickets' inputs with no list to cut by.
2026-10-09 T-0036 An index line for a capability gives its name, its size, the absolute path of its spec and its requirement names. Rejected: the request's "one-sentence purpose", because no capability spec on either store has a purpose paragraph (Evidence).
2026-10-09 T-0036 A decision line goes in full when it is logged against this ticket, or when its text names a capability sent in full as a whole word. The log's other lines are indexed one line per ticket: ticket id, number of decisions, first and last date, and the ticket's title. The index heading gives the command `grep ' <ticket id> ' <absolute path of decisions.md>`. Rejected: one index line per decision, which comes to tens of kilobytes on Nanobot (240 lines, median 278 bytes).
2026-10-09 T-0036 A role opens deferred items by path, with its own file reads or `grep`. No `factory spec show` or `factory decision show` command is added. Rejected: those commands, because a command run from inside a role must clear the live-store fence and find the instance from the role's working directory. A path needs neither, and it is how compose already points at full specs (Evidence).
2026-10-09 T-0036 The instructions live in the index headings. They say the list is complete, that anything in it is opened by its path, and that citing a path hands the capability to the critic. Rejected: editing the writer and critic prompts, which would put the same words in two more protected copies.
2026-10-09 T-0036 A run's `input_sources` lists only the files sent in full. An index adds no source.
2026-10-09 T-0036 The standing 2026-10-04 T-0024 decision says that `decisions.md` "keeps reaching the spec writer, critic and planner". It still does: in full for the lines this ticket touches, and line by line for the rest through the index and its `grep` command.
2026-10-09 T-0036 Acceptance does not hold this change to the request's 40 kB mean and 100 kB maximum. The projection gives a mean of 101 kB and a maximum of 167 kB for the Nanobot store's last ten tickets, and the remainder lies outside this change (Problem, Evidence). The operator steps measure the real figures after the change runs.
2026-10-09 T-0036 The docs use one name for the new index, "capability index".
2026-10-09 T-0037 Decision log in role inputs (#78, T-0037): the spec writer, critic and planner get decisions.md whole; #75's decision filter is removed; any future scoping must not be able to drop a cross-cutting standing decision (see #54).

## Your prior findings (round 1)

Round 1 review of T-0038 spec v1.

Spot-checks (all on `main` at `51e2af7`, the checkout the spec names):
- Cited code: `factory/store.py:228-235` `subtickets_of` (glob, sorted by id), `factory/cli.py:438-468` `subticket_add`, `471-484` `_create_subtickets` (writes `st["spec"]` at 478; nothing records the plan), `549-566` `ticket_ready_implementers` (every list from every sub-ticket), `738-751` `ticket_parent_check` (all-merged test), `912-917` `--replan` refusal, `1302-1306` `_reused_subticket_run`, `1335-1341` `_parent_close_verified`, `161-167` and `1365` guards, `680-688` merge release, `255` sibling-tests read, `492-495` `_planner_needed`, `factory/compose.py:318-322` planner section, `factory/workflows/build.js:264` park, `factory/subtickets.py:141` `ready_implementers`, `tests/factory/test_replan.py:108` `endswith` pin, `docs/design.md:109`, `dev/build-harness.spec.md:286` (the one line matching `ready-implementers PARENT`), `results/<head>/superseded-<n>/` at `cli.py:885-907`. All as described.
- Nanobot log, read only: lines 1392, 1396-1398, 1730-1732, 1751, 1753, 1780-1781 of `.factory/store/log/2026-10.jsonl` say what the Evidence says; `tickets/superseded/T-0024.1.yaml` exists with `approved_version: 2`, `T-0024.2.yaml` has 4.
- Tests pinning behaviour the Decisions touch: `test_shepherd.py:385` (`closed` list), `test_replan.py:108,117,127` (planner section bytes, `--replan` refusals), `test_build_startup.py:84-91` (`subtickets`, `remaining`). Each uses one approved version per parent, where the split marks nothing superseded, so none pins the overturned behaviour. "Tests to change: none" holds as far as reading goes; the `384 passed` claim I could not check without running the suite.
- `ticket set` (`cli.py:97-107`) accepts only a key already in the record, so `planned_from=` works once A writes the field at creation and clears it to null, as the fallback scenario needs. `approve-spec --edit` (`cli.py:788-789`) always adds a version, as the same-version Decision relies on. `ready_implementers` treats a closed sibling dependency as unmet (`subtickets.py:152-153`), which is why T-0001.3 is not in today's `ready`.
- Ran the two no-suite acceptance commands as written, under the HOME wrapper. Documents scenario printed `design=0 build-spec=0 readme=0 changelog=0 CONTIGUOUS`; whitespace scenario printed `whitespace=ok untouched=0`. Both match the verification's "today" lines.
- Consistency: T-0023 decisions (same-version re-plan, next free ids, depends on existing) are kept, with the superseded exception declared. T-0027 v2 Decisions (its line 66, the moved `spec` record) are handled by `planned_from` and the fallback; both merge orders hold, and Risk says so. No `docs/prompts/` block contains `docs/design.md:109`.

Findings

[BLOCKING] 6 proposal.md, Problem first paragraph and Operator steps first paragraph
Problem: Two terms this system made up appear in a human-facing first paragraph before any gloss: "the Nanobot target's T-0024" (target: a repository the factory works on, a row of the README's terms table) and "Nanobot's `factory-store`" (the branch that holds a target's store, another row).
Evidence: `README.md:135` defines target and `README.md:137` defines `factory-store`; the Problem glosses them nowhere, and the Operator steps rely on the briefing's gloss, which the gate operator has not read. Rubric 6 makes an unglossed system term in a first paragraph BLOCKING even when a careful reader could work it out, so I am not waiving it; it is a one-clause fix at each site.
Suggested fix: Problem: "It happened on 2026-10-08 to ticket T-0024 on Nanobot, one of the repositories the factory builds in, and the operator now runs that ticket on a hand-made workaround." Operator steps: "on `factory-store`, the branch that holds Nanobot's store".

[SHOULD-FIX] 6 proposal.md, Problem first paragraph
Problem: The paragraph says what is wrong (the build stops for good) but names who has it only by implication; the affected people arrive in paragraph four.
Evidence: Writing standard rule 1 asks that a reader stopping after the first paragraph can say who has the problem.
Suggested fix: Add to the first sentence "and the operator can only hand-edit store records to get past it", or fold the suggested rewrite above, which names the operator.

[NIT] 6 proposal.md, Problem paragraph four
Problem: "a command that amends a pinned spec" uses "pinned" without saying what a pinned spec is.
Evidence: First use of "pinned" in the spec; the term is not general.
Suggested fix: "amends an approved spec after planning" or add "(the approved version the build works from)".

Not checked, for the implementer and verifier: the prototype outputs of the NEW scenarios, in particular that `_parent_close_verified` accepts the fixture's verifier run in "With the new plan merged, the re-planned parent reaches its final check and closes" (the fixture's merges carry no `main_after`, so the head test is vacuous there, which is fine for what the scenario tests), and `384 passed`. Both need the change built.

Substance: no blocking issue. The split rule (unmerged and `planned_from` below the parent's highest) handles the Nanobot stand-in record without migration, the T-0027 moved record, and the same-version re-plan; the `Depends on` refusal plus the planner line close the only way a new plan could wait on a superseded sub-ticket; every lettered part is needed; the protected path is declared.

Out-of-scope observations: none.

STATUS: REVISE
CONFIDENCE: high; every cited path, log line and test pin was read, two acceptance commands ran as written and matched, and the one blocking item is a wording rule the rubric states outright.
ESCALATIONS: none

 ## Problem
 
-When the human sends an already-planned ticket back for a new spec, the ticket's build stops for good on work from the old plan. It happened on the Nanobot target's T-0024 on 2026-10-08, and that ticket now runs on a hand-made workaround.
-
-Some terms first. The factory builds a ticket from a spec the human approves at the spec gate, the one point where a human signs off a design before code is written. Each approval is numbered: approved spec v1, v2 and so on. The planner, an agent, splits the approved spec into sub-tickets. Each sub-ticket is one piece of the work, built on its own branch and merged on its own; together they make up the plan. The build loop dispatches each sub-ticket that is ready. When every sub-ticket has merged, one final check runs the whole spec against the merged result and then closes the parent ticket. To park a ticket is to stop it and hand it to a human with a reason.
-
-The design already provides for a change of plan (`docs/design.md:109`). The human may send a planned ticket back, approve a new spec version and have the planner split it again. The new sub-tickets take the next free numbers under the same parent. But the old plan's sub-tickets stay attached, and the build still counts all of them:
-
-- An old sub-ticket the human closed parks the parent at once, with "sub-ticket closed by a human". No command resumes the build from that park. The re-plan command refuses too, because it needs every sub-ticket merged.
+When the operator, the person who runs the factory and approves its work, sends an already-planned ticket back for a new spec, the ticket's build stops for good on work left over from the old plan. The operator can get past it only by hand-editing the files where the factory keeps each ticket's state.

 - The final check and the close refuse while any old sub-ticket is unmerged.

Ticket T-0027 (issue #44), approved but not yet built, adds a command that amends an approved spec after planning, which leads into the same situation.
 
 The fix records on each sub-ticket the approved version it was planned from. When a newer plan exists, an old sub-ticket that never merged is superseded: it is kept with its id and record, but it no longer dispatches, parks the parent or holds back the close. Old sub-tickets that merged stay merged and count as done work. "Superseded" is used in the same sense as the check results a re-check already sets aside: an earlier record that is kept but no longer counted.

 - Superseded is computed whenever sub-tickets are read, not stored. A sub-ticket is superseded when it has not merged and its `planned_from` is lower than the highest `planned_from` among its parent's sub-tickets. Rejected: the request's mark written at re-plan time. That needs a write on every path that adds a plan and a migration for stores that already hold such sub-tickets, such as Nanobot T-0024. Also rejected: comparing with the parent's current approved version. That would supersede the live plan after a T-0027 amendment that keeps it.

-Blast radius: every parent with sub-tickets, through `ready-implementers`, `parent-check`, the close and archive guards, `resolve --replan`, `subticket add` and the planner's input. On a parent whose sub-tickets were all planned from one approved version, the split marks nothing superseded and nothing changes. That is every parent on both stores today, counting Nanobot T-0024 as it stands after the stand-in. On a parent re-planned from a newer version, its unmerged older sub-tickets stop counting.

In round 2, `main` is still at `51e2af7`, and three NEW items were run again verbatim under the HOME wrapper, with the fixtures written to this run's scratch directory. "After a re-spec and a re-plan...", "The build of a re-planned parent..." and "A plan that depends on an old unmerged sub-ticket..." printed exactly the "today" output below. The prototype was not rebuilt in round 2, because this round changes only the wording of proposal.md.
 
 - After a re-spec and a re-plan, only the new plan's sub-tickets count and the old records are kept → NEW. Today it prints `add: ` (no `superseded` in the output), `ready: "ready": ["T-0001.4"]`, `closed: "closed": ["T-0001.2"]`, `superseded: ` (no such list), `kept=T-0001.1.yaml T-0001.2.yaml T-0001.3.yaml T-0001.4.yaml T-0001.yaml logged=0`.
 - The plan a sub-ticket belongs to does not move with its spec record, and a record without it falls back to its creation version → NEW. Today it prints `moved: `, then `unrecorded: `: there is no `superseded` list, and `ticket set ... planned_from=` is refused as an unknown key. An implementation that read `spec.approved_version` instead would leave `T-0001.3` out of the `moved` list (worked from the rule in design.md B; not run).

 - A re-planned parent whose final check failed can be re-planned again past its superseded sub-tickets → NEW. Today it prints `exit=2 parked`. The refusal is `--replan needs every sub-ticket merged: T-0001.2 is closed, T-0001.3 is waiting-dependencies`.
 - The design doc, build spec, README and changelog record superseded plans → NEW. Today it prints `design=0 build-spec=0 readme=0 changelog=0 CONTIGUOUS`.

+- [BLOCKING] 6, unglossed "target" and "`factory-store`": FIXED. The Problem's first paragraph now reads "ticket T-0024 on Nanobot, one of the repositories the factory builds in", with no "target". Operator steps now read "On `factory-store`, the branch that holds Nanobot's ticket state". They also gloss `--accept-harness` as the step by which the operator moves Nanobot onto a harness revision, and no longer say "instance".
+- [SHOULD-FIX] 6, first paragraph does not say who has the problem: FIXED. The first paragraph now names the operator, glossed as "the person who runs the factory and approves its work". It says the operator can get past the stop only by hand-editing the files where the factory keeps each ticket's state. The Problem now calls the person "the operator" throughout, in place of "the human". The quoted park reason "sub-ticket closed by a human" keeps its words.
+- [NIT] 6, "pinned" unglossed: FIXED. Paragraph four now says T-0027 "adds a command that amends an approved spec after planning". It also introduces T-0027 as "approved but not yet built".
+- Also changed, for one name per concept (writing standard rule 9): the Problem, Evidence, Out of scope, Risk and Operator steps now all call the Nanobot fix "the hand-made workaround", in place of a mix of that and "stand-in". One Decision now says "the operator approves with `approve-spec --edit`", in place of "the human". The design, the specs and the acceptance are unchanged from v1.
