## Context for this run (composed by the harness, not part of the request)

Repository: `spec-factory`, the design repo at `~/dev/spec-factory` (branch `main`). It holds the
design and the harness that runs it:
- `docs/design.md`, the design document and the source of truth, with its changelog in
  `docs/changelog.md`;
- `docs/prompts/`, each file a verbatim copy of one prompt block in the design doc; it changes only
  by re-copying that block;
- `dev/`, the working documents for building the factory itself: `dev/build-harness.spec.md` (the
  spec for building the harness), `dev/build-harness.plan.md` (the Planner's decomposition of it),
  `dev/P0-intake-skeleton.md` (the walking skeleton) and `dev/issues.md` (this repo's issue index);
- the harness, as code in this repo: `factory/` (the package, its role prompts and its workflow
  scripts), `bin/factory` (the entry point), `agents/` (the agent definition templates) and
  `tests/factory/` (its suite). Install with `uv sync --frozen`; test with
  `uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory`;
- `.factory/`, this repo's own instance of the factory: `instance.yaml`, this briefing,
  `harness.lock`, closed records (`answers/`, `green-pilot/`) and the live store, `store/`.
  The store is a checkout of its own branch, `factory-store`; the operator commits it there, so a
  store commit never moves `main`.

Two checkouts. Tickets are built and merged in the dev checkout, `~/dev/spec-factory` on `main`.
The factory runs from the runtime checkout, `~/dev/spec-factory-harness`, a detached worktree of
this repo at the harness revision `.factory/harness.lock` has accepted. A merge into `main` never
changes the running code; only the upgrade step moves the runtime, after which the instance
refuses its store until `--accept-harness`. Your shell may start in another directory: use
absolute paths, or `cd ~/dev/spec-factory && <cmd>`.

The Nanobot fork at `~/dev/nanobot-upstream` (branch `feat/lionbot-v3.5`) is instance A: a target
with only `.factory/`, run from the same runtime by its own Driver session. This repo's harness was
imported from its retired `feat/lionbot-v3` branch. Read it only to observe what a fix does there; never write there, and never copy its test names,
line numbers or commit SHAs into a spec. Never read or write `~/.nanobot/` (live credentials).

Acceptance commands must be runnable as written from `~/dev/spec-factory` (grep, sed, diff,
`git diff --check` against the documents, the harness suite). A change to the design doc keeps its
own conventions: its changelog entry in `docs/changelog.md`, `dev/build-harness.spec.md`
consistent with the new text, and any `docs/prompts/` file whose block changed re-copied from it.

The request is an issue draft, written from a real pipeline run: where in the documents,
what happened (the evidence), why it matters, a proposed fix, and the Nanobot-side commit
where a harness fix already exists. The evidence is the requirement; the proposed fix is the
requester's suggestion, not a requirement. Verify the as-built fix in the reference harness
before relying on it; a NEW criterion that already passes on this checkout proves nothing.

Output: write your complete output, in your role's required format and ending with the
STATUS / CONFIDENCE / ESCALATIONS trailer, to the file named under "Output file" below. For
every role but the implementer that is the only file you may create or modify. The implementer
also changes files in its own worktree and commits there, and nowhere else. Then return the same
text as your final message.

This repo's current-state page is the top-level `README.md`. A change to a command, state, stop or
path updates it in the same ticket; read its "Maintaining this page" section before editing it.

Who reads what the roles write here: the operator at the spec gate, and a technical reader new to this project reading the README or a PR description. Gloss every term specific to the factory at first use (docs/writing.md).
## Output file
`/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/runs/run-0353-critic/output.md`

## Running code
Run every test, script or prototype through this wrapper, which gives it a fresh temporary HOME so it cannot write the operator's real home directory: `(export HOME="$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P)"; <command>)`. Put your command in place of <command>. This includes every test or check command the briefing above gives. A throwaway HOME does not stop a write to an absolute path: never run anything that could write a protected path outside the repository.

## Scratch directory
Put every file you make for your own use in this run under `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/runs/run-0353-critic/scratch`: no other run uses it. The harness clears it when the ticket moves on, and keeps it while the ticket is parked.

## Spec under review (v2)

=== proposal.md
## Problem
Since issue #75, a recent change that trimmed each agent's input to save context, three agent roles can miss a standing rule that every ticket must follow. Those roles are the spec writer, which writes a ticket's spec; the critic, which reviews it; and the planner, which splits an approved spec into pieces of work. The rules sit in the decision log, `decisions.md`, one line per standing decision with its date and the ticket that made it. Since #75, a decision line reaches those roles in full only when it was logged against their own ticket, or when its text names a capability they receive in full. A capability is one current-truth spec: the store's record of how one part of the system behaves today, where the store is the factory's per-repository record of tickets, specs and decisions. Every other line is reduced to one entry per ticket in a "decision index", with a `grep` command the role may run to read it.

No decision line in either store names a capability, so the filter hides every rule that some other ticket made. In the operator's replay of a Nanobot ticket, the spec writer put new code in a module that a standing decision rules out, and the critic did not notice. Both had seen that decision only as an index line. The operator has chosen to send the whole decision log to these three roles again and to keep the rest of #75, the capability filter. The cost is about 34 kB more input per run on this repo's store and about 75 kB more on the Nanobot store.

## Evidence
- Replay of #75 on Nanobot ticket T-0032, 2026-10-09 (the request): the new writer put its code in `nanobot/cron/session_sweep.py`. Standing decision T-0003 rules that out: lionbot code goes through upstream's extension points first. The original writer, given the whole log, followed T-0003, and the original critic confirmed it. The replay critic missed the conflict.
- The operator's answer (Answer 1, 2026-10-09) chose to drop the decision filter, remove the decision index and its `grep` instruction, and keep #75's capability half as built. It is already a standing decision, the last line of `.factory/store/decisions.md`: `2026-10-09 T-0037 Decision log in role inputs (#78, T-0037): the spec writer, critic and planner get decisions.md whole; ...`.
- The filter is `add_decisions` in `factory/compose.py:226-255` on `main` (`51e2af7`). Its whole-log branch (`:232-234`) runs only when `selected()` returns `None`, that is when triage's output has no `Capabilities:` line. The filtering (`:235-243`), the trimmed "Decision log" block (`:244-246`) and the "Decision index" section with its `grep` instruction (`:247-255`) follow. Callers: spec writer `:273`, critic `:292`, planner `:315`.
- The capability index note, `CAPABILITY_INDEX_NOTE` at `factory/compose.py:138-142`, tells the writer and critic that citing a capability's path sends "the decisions that name it to the critic and the planner". After this change every decision reaches those roles whatever is cited (Decision 2).
- Today's behaviour, from the fixture `t0036-store.sh` that current truth `role-inputs` defines, run on `main` with a throwaway HOME. The fixture's log has four lines: OWN-LINE (this ticket), BETA-LINE and GAMMA-LINE (naming those capabilities), OTHER-LINE (another ticket, naming none, the T-0003 case). With `Capabilities: beta`, the NEW scenario's command prints:
  ```
  W: own=1 beta-line=1 gamma-line=0 other=0 whole=0 index=1 grep-cmd=1 note-decisions=1 source=1
  C: own=1 beta-line=1 gamma-line=1 other=0 whole=0 index=1 grep-cmd=1 note-decisions=1 source=1
  P: own=1 beta-line=1 gamma-line=1 other=0 whole=0 index=1 grep-cmd=1 note-decisions=0 source=1
  ```
  `other=0` on every line: OTHER-LINE reaches no role. `gamma-line=0` for W: the writer misses GAMMA-LINE too. `index=1 grep-cmd=1`: each role gets a decision index with its `grep` command.
- Size of the decision part of each spec writer, critic and planner input, measured on 2026-10-09 for a new ticket with no decisions of its own. The script mirrors `compose.py:226-255` line for line and adds the whole-log heading for "After" (`scratch/measure.py` of this run). It selected every current-truth capability (11 here, 25 on Nanobot), and still kept no line in full on either store. That confirms the triage count: no decision line names a capability. The Nanobot store is live, so its log will have grown by the time this ships.

  | Store | Log lines | Log size | Before (#75 filter): kept lines | Before: index | Before: total | After (whole log) |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | spec-factory | 109 | 35,991 B | 0 | 12 tickets | 2,581 B | 36,055 B |
  | Nanobot | 266 | 79,997 B | 0 | 27 tickets | 4,875 B | 80,061 B |

  The rise is about 33.5 kB per input on spec-factory and 75 kB on Nanobot. That is in line with the operator's estimates of writer input after the change: about 135 kB on spec-factory and about 235 kB on Nanobot.
- Docs that state #75's decision rule today: `docs/design.md:94` (the sentence ending "a decision index for the rest: one line per other ticket, with the `grep` command ..."), and the Spec writer, Spec critic and Planner rows of `README.md:85-87`. The docs scenario's command prints `design-index=1 design-whole=0 readme-index=3 readme-whole=0 changelog=0` on `main`: the design doc and all three README rows still describe the decision index, and no changelog entry for #78 exists. No `docs/prompts/` file and no part of `dev/build-harness.spec.md` names the decision index. `dev/build-harness.spec.md:193` already says `run compose` gives `decisions.md` to the spec writer, critic and planner, with no filter.
- Tests that pin the filter: `tests/factory/test_capability_index.py:192-238` and the note text at `:22` and `:122-126` (Tests to change). `tests/factory/test_decision_log.py:205-215` already expects the whole-log heading and passes before and after.
- Harness suite on `main` (`51e2af7`), with a throwaway HOME and the default TMPDIR: the suite scenario's command printed `suite=0`, with `384 passed in 229.97s`. With TMPDIR set inside this repo's `.factory/`, 4 tests in `tests/factory/test_instance.py` fail, because they need a directory outside every factory instance; the suite scenario therefore runs with TMPDIR unset or outside any instance.

## Root cause
`add_decisions` in `factory/compose.py:226-255` keeps a decision line only when it is logged against the ticket or names a selected capability, as a whole word. A cross-cutting standing decision names no capability, so for any ticket with a `Capabilities:` line it is reduced to an index entry. The writer, critic and planner then follow only the rules they choose to open.

## Out of scope
- Triage's input: still the capability index and no decision line.
- Which capabilities the writer and critic receive in full, the capability index and its lines, and the triage prompt's `Capabilities:` line. The only change to #75's capability half is one clause of the index note (Decision 2).
- The current-truth requirement "A ticket whose triage output names no capabilities receives today's inputs". It stays true as written.
- `dev/build-harness.spec.md` and every `docs/prompts/` file: none states the decision filter.
- Any new scoping of the decision log, such as #54's product and implementation tagging.
- The contents of `decisions.md`, and the status cell of #78's history rows in `README.md` and `dev/issues.md`, which the operator's `dev:` commits keep.
- The runtime move itself (Operator steps).

## Open questions
none

## Decisions
- The spec writer, critic and planner receive `decisions.md` whole whenever it holds any text, whatever capabilities their ticket names. The decision index and its `grep` instruction are removed. This is the operator's Answer 1, already standing in `decisions.md` as the 2026-10-09 T-0037 line. Rejected: the request's rule of sending lines that name no capability in full and filtering the rest. On today's logs it sends every line anyway, and it could still hide a cross-cutting decision that happens to name a capability.
- The capability index note loses its clause ", and the decisions that name it to the critic and the planner,"; the rest of the note stays word for word. Rejected: keeping the clause, which would tell the writer that citing a path is how decisions reach the critic and planner. That is no longer so. This edits one sentence of #75's capability half, which the triage assumption kept byte for byte.
- The planner's decision part no longer reads triage's capability names or the approved spec's citations. It reads the whole log, as before #75.
- The decision part is measured in this spec's Evidence, before and after, on both stores. No new file or harness command records it.

## Risk
Blast radius: the input of every spec writer, critic and planner run on every target that adopts this harness revision. Each grows by the size of its log, about 34 kB here and 75 kB on Nanobot per run (Evidence). Triage, implementer, reviewer and verifier inputs do not change. A mistake here would drop decisions from those inputs or break the capability half. The NEW role-inputs scenario and the two REGRESSION scenarios cover both.
Protected paths touched: harness, `factory/**`, through `factory/compose.py`. The other files changed are `tests/factory/test_capability_index.py` (existing tests, listed under Tests to change), `docs/design.md`, `docs/changelog.md` and `README.md`, none of them protected. No `docs/prompts/` file changes.

## Operator steps
- Merging this change does not by itself change what the roles receive. Tickets run from the runtime, a separate checkout of the harness pinned to one commit (`~/dev/spec-factory-harness`), and a merge into `main` never moves it. #75 is merged but held from the runtime until this fix merges. After merge, move the runtime once to the merge commit, so that #75 and this fix ship together (README, "Upgrading the runtime", step 1).
- Each target repository runs only the harness commit recorded in its `harness.lock`, and refuses its store after a runtime move until it accepts the new commit. In each target that should adopt this change, run any store command once with `--accept-harness <sha>`, where `<sha>` is the runtime's new commit (README, "Upgrading the runtime", step 2).
- On the first spec writer run in each target after that, check that its `input.md` holds `## Decision log (decisions.md): standing decisions, read-only` and no `## Decision index`.

=== design.md
## Proposed change
A. `factory/compose.py`, the decision log in role inputs.
   1. `add_decisions` (`:226-255`) takes no argument. When `decisions.md` is missing or holds only whitespace it adds nothing, as today. Otherwise it calls `add("decisions.md", "Decision log (decisions.md): standing decisions, read-only")` and returns. Remove the filtering (`:235-243`), the trimmed "Decision log ... logged against this ticket or naming a capability given in full" block (`:244-246`) and the whole "Decision index" section with its `title()` helper and `grep` instruction (`:247-255`).
   2. The callers become `add_decisions()`. For the spec writer (`:273`) and the critic (`:292`) they stay right after `add_truth(sel)`, so the log still follows current truth and the capability index. The planner (`:315`) no longer calls `selected()`. Its comment says the planner gets no current truth and the whole log.
   3. `CAPABILITY_INDEX_NOTE` (`:138-142`) becomes, word for word: "This list is complete: every current-truth capability not given in full above has one line here. Open a capability at its path before you rely on it. A spec that cites a capability's path, as `openspec/specs/<name>/spec.md`, sends that capability in full to the critic, so cite under Evidence each capability you open."
   4. `selected()`, `add_truth()`, the capability index and the triage branch stay as they are. `input_sources` lists `decisions.md` for these three roles whenever the log holds text, as the `add` helper already does.
B. `tests/factory/test_capability_index.py`: replace the decision-filter tests (Tests to change) with tests of the whole log: with `Capabilities: beta`, and with `Capabilities: none`, each of the spec writer, critic and planner inputs holds the whole-log heading followed by every fixture line, and no `Decision index`. Update the module docstring and the note text. Keep `test_a_whitespace_only_log_still_adds_nothing` and the part-B4 test as they are.
C. Documents.
   1. `docs/design.md:94`, §Harness, "Spec store" paragraph. Replace its last two sentences, from "They and the planner receive the decision log's lines ..." to the end, with: "They and the planner receive the whole decision log, `decisions.md`, when it holds any text, whatever capabilities the ticket names: a standing decision often names no capability, yet every ticket must follow it. A ticket whose latest triage output has no `Capabilities:` line gets every current-truth spec in full."
   2. `README.md`, the role table.
      - Spec writer row (`:85`): replace "the decision log's lines for this ticket and those capabilities, and a decision index for the rest, one line per other ticket" with "the whole decision log".
      - Spec critic row (`:86`): replace "the decision log's lines for this ticket and those capabilities, and a decision index for the rest" with "the whole decision log".
      - Planner row (`:87`): replace "the decision log's lines for this ticket and its capabilities, and a decision index for the rest" with "the whole decision log".
      - Bump the Status line's date to the day of the change, per "Maintaining this page". The terms row for "ruling, decision log" (`:128`) is already true and stays.
   3. `docs/changelog.md`: add entry 61 after entry 60, in that list's form, starting `61. After issue #78 (2026-10-09), where`. It says what went wrong: #75's filter reduced every decision of another ticket to an index line, because no line names a capability, and in the replay a writer broke a cross-cutting decision while the critic missed it. It says what changed: the three roles receive the whole log again, the decision index and its `grep` command are gone, and the capability index stays. It gives the size change as measured on 2026-10-09 (Evidence table), rounded: the decision part of each input grows from under 3 kB to about 36 kB here, and from about 5 kB to about 80 kB on Nanobot. It names the rejected alternative, the request's rule of filtering only lines that name a capability (Decision 1).

## Tests to change
- `tests/factory/test_capability_index.py:1-9`, module docstring: says the writer, critic and planner get only the decision lines of their ticket and capabilities, plus an index. Follows Decision 1.
- `tests/factory/test_capability_index.py:22` (`CITES`) and `:122-126` in `test_writer_gets_the_named_capability_in_full_and_an_index_line_for_each_other`: pin the note clause that Decision 2 removes.
- `tests/factory/test_capability_index.py:194-203`, helpers `decision_block` and `decision_index`: build the trimmed-log heading and the decision index that Decision 1 removes.
- `tests/factory/test_capability_index.py:206-217`, `test_each_role_gets_its_ticket_s_and_its_capabilities_decisions_and_an_index_of_the_rest`: expects OTHER-LINE left out and an index. Follows Decision 1 (and Decision 3 for the planner).
- `tests/factory/test_capability_index.py:220-224`, `test_a_decision_index_line_carries_the_ticket_s_title`: the index no longer exists. Follows Decision 1.
- `tests/factory/test_capability_index.py:227-232`, `test_no_kept_line_leaves_only_the_index_and_no_decisions_source`: expects no `## Decision log` and no `decisions.md` source with `Capabilities: none`. Both now appear. Follows Decision 1.
- `tests/factory/test_capability_index.py:235-238`, `test_every_line_kept_leaves_no_decision_index`: expects the trimmed-log heading. Follows Decision 1.

=== specs/role-inputs/spec.md
## REMOVED Requirements
### Requirement: The spec writer, critic and planner receive in full only the decisions of their ticket and its capabilities, and a decision index for the rest
Reason: the filter hid every cross-cutting standing decision, because no decision line names a capability; the three roles receive the whole decision log instead (the operator's answer to #78).

## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: The spec writer, critic and planner receive the whole decision log, whatever capabilities their ticket names
Whenever `decisions.md` holds any text, the spec writer, critic and planner inputs SHALL hold it whole, under the heading `## Decision log (decisions.md): standing decisions, read-only`, and SHALL list it in `input_sources`, whether or not the ticket's latest finished triage output has a `Capabilities:` line; they MUST hold no decision index. Triage MUST still receive no decision line, and the capabilities each role receives in full, with the capability index, MUST stay as they are.

#### Scenario: With a Capabilities line every decision line reaches the writer, critic and planner, and no decision index does
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ticket naming one capability composes inputs with only that capability in full and an index line for each other one" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0036-store.sh 'Capabilities: beta'; for v in W C P; do eval f=\$$v; echo "$v: own=$(grep -c OWN-LINE $f) beta-line=$(grep -c BETA-LINE $f) gamma-line=$(grep -c GAMMA-LINE $f) other=$(grep -c OTHER-LINE $f) whole=$(grep -cxF '## Decision log (decisions.md): standing decisions, read-only' $f) index=$(grep -c '^## Decision index' $f) grep-cmd=$(grep -cF "grep ' <ticket id> '" $f) note-decisions=$(grep -cF 'and the decisions that name it' $f) source=$(grep -cx -- '- decisions.md' $(dirname $f)/meta.yaml)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `W: own=1 beta-line=1 gamma-line=1 other=1 whole=1 index=0 grep-cmd=0 note-decisions=0 source=1`, then the same with `C:`, then the same with `P:`. OTHER-LINE, logged against another ticket and naming no capability, reaches all three roles. No role gets a decision index or its `grep` instruction, and the capability index note no longer speaks of decisions.

#### Scenario: The capabilities each role receives and triage's input are unchanged by the whole log
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ticket naming one capability composes inputs with only that capability in full and an index line for each other one" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0036-store.sh 'Capabilities: beta'; y() { grep -F -- "$S/openspec/specs/$1/spec.md" $f | grep -qF -- "The $1 part works" && echo y || echo n; }; for v in W C P; do eval f=\$$v; echo "$v: alpha=$(grep -c ALPHA-BODY $f) beta=$(grep -c BETA-BODY $f) gamma=$(grep -c GAMMA-BODY $f) alpha-index=$(y alpha) gamma-index=$(y gamma) cites=$(grep -cF 'sends that capability in full to the critic' $f)"; done; f=$I; echo "triage: alpha-index=$(y alpha) beta-index=$(y beta) gamma-index=$(y gamma) bodies=$(grep -c -- '-BODY' $f) decisions=$(grep -c -- '-LINE' $f)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `W: alpha=0 beta=1 gamma=0 alpha-index=y gamma-index=y cites=1`, then `C: alpha=0 beta=1 gamma=1 alpha-index=y gamma-index=n cites=1`, then `P: alpha=0 beta=0 gamma=0 alpha-index=n gamma-index=n cites=0`, then `triage: alpha-index=y beta-index=y gamma-index=y bodies=0 decisions=0`

#### Scenario: The harness suite passes with the whole decision log
Run with TMPDIR unset or outside any `.factory/` instance: some suite tests need a directory outside every instance.
- WHEN `(export HOME="$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P)"; uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "suite=$?")`
- THEN it prints exactly `suite=0`

=== specs/harness-docs/spec.md
## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: The documents describe the whole decision log for the spec writer, critic and planner
`docs/design.md` and the README's Spec writer, Spec critic and Planner rows MUST say that those roles receive the whole decision log, and neither MUST mention a decision index. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL have an entry for issue #78, with no whitespace error in the change.

#### Scenario: The design, README and changelog describe the whole decision log and no decision index
- WHEN `(echo "design-index=$(grep -c 'decision index' docs/design.md) design-whole=$(grep -c 'They and the planner receive the whole decision log' docs/design.md) readme-index=$(grep -c 'decision index' README.md) readme-whole=$(grep -E '^\| (Spec writer|Spec critic|Planner) \(' README.md | grep -c 'the whole decision log') changelog=$(grep -c '^[0-9]*\. After issue #78 ' docs/changelog.md)"; git diff --check main...HEAD && echo whitespace=ok)`
- THEN it prints exactly `design-index=0 design-whole=1 readme-index=0 readme-whole=3 changelog=1`, then `whitespace=ok`

=== verification.md
## Acceptance
- With a Capabilities line every decision line reaches the writer, critic and planner, and no decision index does → NEW; on `main` (`51e2af7`) it prints `W: own=1 beta-line=1 gamma-line=0 other=0 whole=0 index=1 grep-cmd=1 note-decisions=1 source=1`, `C: ... gamma-line=1 other=0 whole=0 index=1 grep-cmd=1 note-decisions=1 ...` and `P: ... other=0 whole=0 index=1 grep-cmd=1 note-decisions=0 ...` (Evidence): OTHER-LINE is missing from all three and a decision index is present.
- The capabilities each role receives and triage's input are unchanged by the whole log → REGRESSION; on `main` it prints exactly the expected four lines (run through the fixture with a throwaway HOME).
- The harness suite passes with the whole decision log → REGRESSION; on `main` (`51e2af7`) with a throwaway HOME and the default TMPDIR it printed `suite=0` (384 passed).
- The design, README and changelog describe the whole decision log and no decision index → NEW; on `main` it prints `design-index=1 design-whole=0 readme-index=3 readme-whole=0 changelog=0`, then `whitespace=ok`.

## Responses
- [BLOCKING] Operator steps, runtime and `--accept-harness` not glossed → FIXED. The first Operator step now says what the runtime is (a separate checkout of the harness pinned to one commit, which a merge into `main` never moves) and why merging alone changes nothing. A new second step says what `harness.lock` and `--accept-harness <sha>` do. Both cite README "Upgrading the runtime" (`README.md:539-545`), whose steps they follow.
- [NIT] Nanobot size figures stale → FIXED. Re-measured on 2026-10-09 with the same mirror script: Nanobot is 266 lines and 79,997 B, before 4,875 B (27 tickets indexed, 0 lines kept), after 80,061 B; spec-factory unchanged at 109 lines, 2,581 B before and 36,055 B after. The table caption is dated and notes the Nanobot log is live. The Problem and Risk figures moved from 72 kB to 75 kB. Changelog part C.3 now gives rounded figures as of that date: under 3 kB to about 36 kB here, about 5 kB to about 80 kB on Nanobot.
- [NIT] "the store" unglossed in Problem → FIXED. The capability gloss now ends "where the store is the factory's per-repository record of tickets, specs and decisions". I also introduced issue #75 at first use as "a recent change that trimmed each agent's input to save context" (writing standard rule 6).
- Not a finding, but strengthened: the suite REGRESSION claim now rests on a full run, not a subset. On `main` with a throwaway HOME and the default TMPDIR, the suite scenario's command printed `suite=0` (384 passed); Evidence and Acceptance say so.

## Current truth: build-dispatch

# build-dispatch

## Requirements

### Requirement: A park reason carries the failing command's error
When a store command fails and its relayed stderr is empty, the workflow scripts MUST put the refusal's JSON `error`, or else the exit code, after the reason's prefix, so that no park reason ends blank.

#### Scenario: A refused archive or sub-ticket add parks with the refusal text
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify"}}, "ticket parent-check": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify", "reuse": "run-0001-verifier"}}, "archive": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "no spec store (factory init not run)"}, "exit": 2}}'; node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-planner"}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "PLANNED"}}, "subticket add": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "ST-2: no Depends on line"}, "exit": 2}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `park: archive: no spec store (factory init not run)`, then `start: planner`, then `park: harness-bug: subticket add: ST-2: no Depends on line`

#### Scenario: A refused run start during intake parks with the refusal text
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/intake.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-triage", "round": {"spec": 0}}}, "run start": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "T-0001 is parked, not ready-for-triage"}, "exit": 2}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: triage`, then `park: harness-bug: run start triage: T-0001 is parked, not ready-for-triage`

#### Scenario: A command that prints no JSON parks with its exit code
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify"}}, "ticket parent-check": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify", "reuse": "run-0001-verifier"}}, "archive": {"raw": "", "exit": 1}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `park: archive: exit 1, no JSON on stdout`

### Requirement: The build runs only the checkers a commit still needs
When a sub-ticket reaches the checks without an implementer run in that pass, the build MUST run only the checkers that have no result row on its commit; after an implementer run it SHALL run both.

#### Scenario: A redispatched sub-ticket runs only the checker whose row was set aside
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show T-0001 ": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "planned"}}, "ticket ready-implementers": [{"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": ["T-0001.1"], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}, {"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}], "ticket show T-0001.1": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "checks-in-flight"}}, "ticket head": {"out": {"ok": true, "head": "abababababababababababababababababababab"}}, "results show": {"out": {"ok": true, "rows": {"verifier": "VERIFIED", "ci": "PASS"}, "missing": ["reviewer"]}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "APPROVE"}}, "ticket join": {"out": {"ok": true, "decision": "park", "reason": "stub stop"}}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: reviewer`, then `park: stub stop`

#### Scenario: After an implementer run both checkers run
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show T-0001 ": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "planned"}}, "ticket ready-implementers": [{"out": {"ok": true, "ready": ["T-0001.1"], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}, {"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}], "ticket show T-0001.1": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-implementer"}}, "ticket head": {"out": {"ok": true, "head": "abababababababababababababababababababab"}}, "results show": {"out": {"ok": true, "rows": {"reviewer": "REQUEST-CHANGES", "verifier": "VERIFIED", "ci": "PASS"}, "missing": []}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "READY-FOR-REVIEW"}}, "ticket join": {"out": {"ok": true, "decision": "park", "reason": "stub stop"}}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: implementer`, `start: reviewer`, `start: verifier`, `park: stub stop`, one per line

### Requirement: The workflows' clerk commands carry the dispatcher marker
Every store command that `factory/workflows/intake.js` and `factory/workflows/build.js` send to the clerk MUST carry `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` in its environment assignments, so that a dispatch SHALL still complete on a live store while its own role run is in flight.

#### Scenario: Every clerk command of both workflows carries the marker
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once.
- WHEN `(echo "intake: $(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-count.mjs factory/workflows/intake.js)"; echo "build: $(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-count.mjs factory/workflows/build.js)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `intake: sent unmarked=0`, then `build: sent unmarked=0`

#### Scenario: An intake run against a real store reaches its end with its run in flight
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once. The clerk commands run for real on a scratch instance's own store, from the checkout under test, and the triage run is in flight when the workflow records its result.
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && (cd $T/tgt && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md && $B ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null) && echo "returned=$(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-e2e.mjs $T/tgt/.factory) stored=$(cd $T/tgt && $B ticket show T-0001 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `returned=closed stored=closed`

### Requirement: An implementer starts only when each sibling-added test it may change came from a merged sibling
`factory run start --role implementer` on a sub-ticket MUST refuse with exit 2, writing no run, worktree, branch or in-flight entry, with an error that starts `BLOCKED from harness: ` and names the file, when a line `` `<file>` (added by <ID>) `` inside its "Tests to change" field names a file that existed at the parent's base, or whose first adding commit on the integration branch since that base lies inside no merged sibling's recorded merge. It SHALL accept a file a merged sibling's merge added, and SHALL ignore such a line outside that field.

#### Scenario: A test file a merged sibling added may be listed, and a mention outside Tests to change is ignored
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `git` and `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the two fixture files written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names them reuses them)

- THEN it prints exactly `exit=0 ready-for-implementer runs=1`

#### Scenario: A listed test that predates the plan, came from no sibling's merge, or was never added is refused before the implementer starts
Needs the GIVEN block of "A test file a merged sibling added may be listed, and a mention outside Tests to change is ignored" run once.
- WHEN `(for E in tests/test_old.py tests/test_operator.py tests/test_never.py; do (. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-sib.sh && bin/factory run start --role implementer --ticket T-0001.2 >$T22/o 2>/dev/null; x=$?; J=$(tail -1 $T22/o); echo "exit=$x blocked=$(echo "$J" | grep -c '"error": "BLOCKED from harness: ') names=$(echo "$J" | grep -cF "$E") runs=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs 2>/dev/null | grep -c .) branch=$(git -C $FACTORY_REPO branch --list 'factory/T-0001.2' | grep -c .) $(bin/factory ticket show T-0001.2 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')"); done)`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `exit=2 blocked=1 names=1 runs=0 branch=0 ready-for-implementer`

### Requirement: The build parks a harness-blocked sub-ticket as BLOCKED, so a ruling returns it
When an implementer's run start is refused with an error that starts `BLOCKED `, the build workflow SHALL park the sub-ticket with that error, verbatim, as the reason, so that `factory resolve <id> --ruling F` MUST accept the park and return the sub-ticket to `ready-for-implementer`.

#### Scenario: The build parks the blocked sub-ticket with the harness's reason, and a ruling sends it back
Needs the GIVEN block of "A test file a merged sibling added may be listed, and a mention outside Tests to change is ignored" run once.
- WHEN `(E=tests/test_old.py; . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-sib.sh && node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-build.mjs | sed 's/\(BLOCKED from harness:\).*/\1/'; printf 'Ruling: x\n' > $T22/r.md; bin/factory resolve T-0001.2 --ruling $T22/r.md >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "ruling=$? $(bin/factory ticket show T-0001.2 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `park T-0001.2: BLOCKED from harness:`, then `ruling=0 ready-for-implementer`

### Requirement: The build asks the whole-spec step before it runs the planner
At `ready-for-planner`, `factory/workflows/build.js` MUST first run `plan whole-spec`. On `"planner": "skipped"` it SHALL move the parent to `planned` and build the sub-ticket with no planner run. On any other success it SHALL run the planner as before. On a refusal it MUST park the parent with `harness-bug: plan whole-spec: <error>`.

#### Scenario: A qualifying spec reaches its implementer with no planner run, and a refused whole-spec step parks with its error
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show T-0001 ": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-planner"}}, "plan whole-spec": {"out": {"ok": true, "planner": "skipped", "reason": "fixture", "subtickets": [{"id": "T-0001.1"}]}}, "ticket ready-implementers": [{"out": {"ok": true, "ready": ["T-0001.1"], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}, {"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}], "ticket show T-0001.1": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-implementer"}}, "ticket head": {"out": {"ok": true, "head": "abababababababababababababababababababab"}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "READY-FOR-REVIEW"}}, "ticket join": {"out": {"ok": true, "decision": "park", "reason": "stub stop"}}}'; node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-planner"}}, "plan whole-spec": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "T-0001 has no approved spec"}, "exit": 2}}')`

- THEN it prints exactly `start: planner`, then `park: harness-bug: subticket add: stub stop`

### Requirement: A role run that leaves no output is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT
When a role run ends without an output file, or with a blank one, whatever the agent call returned, `run finish` MUST record it as `EMPTY-OUTPUT` and never as `KILLED`. The workflow MUST keep the agent's non-blank last message as that run's `last-message.md` and re-dispatch the same role once. A second `EMPTY-OUTPUT` in a row SHALL park the ticket as `EMPTY-OUTPUT from <role>`, with no result row for that run.

#### Scenario: A reviewer that ends its turn waiting on its own commands is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT beside the verifier's passing rows
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `git` and `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell. This scenario needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.

- THEN it prints exactly `start: triage`, then `start: triage`, then `park: EMPTY-OUTPUT from triage`

### Requirement: A role run that writes its output runs once and routes on its STATUS
A role run whose output file holds a STATUS MUST NOT be re-dispatched, and the build SHALL route on that STATUS as before.

#### Scenario: A reviewer that writes its output runs once
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "A reviewer that ends its turn waiting on its own commands is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT beside the verifier's passing rows" run once.

# gate-commands

## Requirements

### Requirement: A gate command may declare its paths and is skipped for a sub-ticket that touches none of them
Each `gate_commands` entry SHALL be a command string or a mapping of `command` and an optional `paths` list of git pathspecs. When a reviewer or verifier run starts on a sub-ticket, the harness MUST mark SKIPPED, with its reason, each command whose paths the diff from base to head touches none of. It MUST list that command apart from the commands to run, and record it in the run's `meta.yaml`. A command with no `paths` SHALL always be listed to run.

#### Scenario: A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the fixture file written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

```sh
cat > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-sub.sh <<'EOF'
# Sourced from the repo root, with $1 the file the sub-ticket's one commit changes (docs/b.md or
# src/a.txt) and $2 `scoped` or `plain`. Builds a scratch instance and target. `scoped` gives the
# gate the unscoped command `git diff --check main...HEAD` and the command `sh -c 'exit 7'` scoped
# to `src/`; `plain` keeps the fixture's one unscoped command. Sub-ticket T-0001.1 reaches
# checks-in-flight with that commit as its head; a verifier run is started and composed on it.
# Leaves $B (the CLI), $T, $I (the implementer run), $R and $V (the verifier run and its
# directory), $H (the head) and $COMPOSE (that compose's exit code).

- THEN it prints exactly `compose=0 run=1 skipped=1 meta=1`

#### Scenario: A diff that touches a scoped command's paths runs that command
Needs the GIVEN block of "A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-sub.sh src/a.txt scoped && echo "compose=$COMPOSE run=$(grep -F 'Gate commands' $V/input.md 2>/dev/null | grep -F 'git diff --check main...HEAD' | grep -cF 'exit 7') skipped=$(grep -c '^SKIPPED' $V/input.md 2>/dev/null)")`

#### Scenario: A gate command with no paths runs on every diff, as today
Needs the GIVEN block of "A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them" run once.

- THEN it prints exactly `compose=0 run=1 skipped=0`

### Requirement: A skipped command is recorded on the gate result, and the merge still needs that result to pass
When a verifier's result is recorded, the `ci` row MUST list each command that verifier run skipped, with status SKIPPED and its reason. `factory merge` SHALL still refuse unless that row is PASS.

#### Scenario: A skipped gate command is recorded on the gate result, and the merge still needs a passing gate
Needs the GIVEN block of "A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-sub.sh docs/b.md scoped && for g in FAIL PASS; do printf 'Commit: %s\nGate suite: %s\nSTATUS: VERIFIED\nCONFIDENCE: high, fixture\nESCALATIONS: none\n' $H $g > $T/v.md; printf 'Commit: %s\nSTATUS: APPROVE\nCONFIDENCE: high, fixture\nESCALATIONS: none\n' $H > $T/r.md; $B results record T-0001.1 --head $H --role verifier --output $T/v.md --run $R >/dev/null; $B results record T-0001.1 --head $H --role reviewer --output $T/r.md --run run-0003-reviewer >/dev/null; $B merge T-0001.1 >/dev/null 2>&1; m=$?; C=$T/store/results/$H/ci.yaml; echo "$g: merge=$m recorded=$(grep -q 'exit 7' $C && grep -q SKIPPED $C && echo yes || echo no)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `FAIL: merge=2 recorded=yes`, then `PASS: merge=0 recorded=yes`

### Requirement: The implementer is given every gate command
The implementer's input SHALL list every gate command to run, scoped or not, and no SKIPPED line.

#### Scenario: The implementer is still given every gate command
Needs the GIVEN block of "A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-sub.sh docs/b.md scoped && $B run compose $I >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "compose=$? both=$(grep -F 'Gate commands' $T/store/runs/$I/input.md 2>/dev/null | grep -F 'git diff --check main...HEAD' | grep -cF 'exit 7') skipped=$(grep -c '^SKIPPED' $T/store/runs/$I/input.md 2>/dev/null)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `compose=0 both=1 skipped=0`

### Requirement: A malformed gate entry refuses every build role's run start
A `gate_commands` entry MUST make `run start` refuse with exit 2 for the implementer, reviewer or verifier, naming `gate_commands` and creating no run, when it is anything other than one of these: a string; or a mapping with a non-empty string `command`, an optional non-empty list of non-empty strings `paths`, and no other key.

#### Scenario: A malformed gate entry refuses a checker's run start and creates no run
Needs the GIVEN block of "A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them" run once.
- WHEN `(for bad in '{command: "true", path: ["src/"]}' '{command: "true", paths: "src/"}'; do (. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-sub.sh docs/b.md plain && grep -v '^gate_commands:' $T/inst/instance.yaml > $T/i.yaml && echo "gate_commands: [$bad]" >> $T/i.yaml && mv $T/i.yaml $T/inst/instance.yaml && n=$(ls $T/store/runs | wc -l) && $B run start --role reviewer --ticket T-0001.1 >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? new_runs=$(( $(ls $T/store/runs | wc -l) - n )) named=$(grep -c 'gate_commands' $T/err)"); done)`

## Requirements

### Requirement: The documents record the change
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain entry 51 covering every part, numbered without a gap, `README.md` SHALL describe the new `resolve` behaviour and relative environment paths, and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the change in order
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print n, (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; sed -n '/^51\. /p' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e BLOCKED -e '--replan' -e 'next free' -e 'error text' -e redispatch -e '-whitespace' -e context.md -e relative -e uncommitted | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `51 CONTIGUOUS`, then `9`

#### Scenario: The README describes the new resolve verbs
- WHEN `(echo "replan=$(grep -c -- '--replan' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') gap=$(grep -c 'has no .resolve. verb' README.md)")`
- THEN it prints `replan=1 gap=0`

#### Scenario: The README says relative paths resolve from the caller's directory
- WHEN `(grep -c 'relative .FACTORY_' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')`
- THEN it prints `1`

#### Scenario: The change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the live-store guard
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for this change as its last numbered entry, numbered without a gap; `docs/design.md` SHALL describe the dispatcher marker and the run-directory rule; README's "Where a human decides" SHALL open with the marker's exact command form and say that the refusal deliberately does not name it; README SHALL say the final verifier run is listed as in flight and SHALL no longer say the factory's capabilities never entered the spec store; no prompt copy under `docs/prompts/` or `factory/prompts/` SHALL change; and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the guard as its last entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -oF -e FACTORY_DISPATCH -e 'in flight' -e throwaway -e 'exit 2' -e 'worktrees/' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: The design doc names the marker and the run-directory rule, and no prompt copy changes
- WHEN `(echo "design=$(grep -c FACTORY_DISPATCH docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') dirs=$(grep FACTORY_DISPATCH docs/design.md | grep -c 'worktrees/' | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') prompts=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design=1 dirs=1 prompts=0`

#### Scenario: README tells the operator how to write during a run, first thing under Where a human decides
- WHEN `(H=$(sed -n '/^## Where a human decides/,/^## What is built/p' README.md); J=$(echo "$H" | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "first=$(echo "$H" | sed -n '3p' | grep -c 'FACTORY_DISPATCH=1') command=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 [^ ]*bin/factory ') unnamed=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'deliberately does not name the marker') export=$(echo "$J" | grep -ci 'never export') rundirs=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'worktrees/')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `first=1 command=1 unnamed=1 export=1 rundirs=1`

#### Scenario: README says the final verifier run is listed as in flight
- WHEN `(R=$(tr '\n' ' ' < README.md | tr -s ' '); echo "stale=$(echo "$R" | grep -o 'does not list it as in flight' | grep -c .) listed=$(echo "$R" | grep -o 'lists it as in flight' | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `stale=0 listed=1`

#### Scenario: README no longer says the factory's capabilities never entered the spec store
- WHEN `(echo "bullet=$(grep -c 'Current truth for the factory itself' README.md) stale=$(grep -c 'never entered it' README.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `bullet=1 stale=0`

#### Scenario: The guard change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents describe the store branch
The design doc SHALL name the store branch `factory-store` and the never-tracked path rule, and the build spec SHALL call the store branch only `factory-store`. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one contiguously numbered entry recording the change. `README.md` SHALL describe committing the store on its branch, `factory store migrate`, the `git clean -ffdx` hazard and a checkout from before the move, and SHALL no longer say that a store commit moves the integration branch or give `.factory/state/` as the live store's location. The change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design doc names the store branch and the path rule
- WHEN `(Q=$(printf '\140'); echo "store_branch=$(grep -c 'factory-store' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') tickets_branch=$(grep -c "${Q}tickets${Q} branch" docs/design.md) never_tracked=$(grep -c 'never tracked' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints `store_branch=1 tickets_branch=0 never_tracked=1`

#### Scenario: The build spec calls the store branch factory-store
- WHEN `(Q=$(printf '\140'); echo "old_name=$(grep -c "${Q}tickets${Q}\|refs/heads/tickets\|HEAD:tickets" dev/build-harness.spec.md) new_name=$(grep -c 'factory-store' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints `old_name=0 new_name=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records the store branch in one contiguous entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep -E '^[0-9]+\. ' docs/changelog.md | grep 'factory-store' | grep -c 'never tracked')`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`

#### Scenario: The README describes the store branch and the move
`old_cost` joins the page into one line first, because the retired clause is wrapped across two lines. `old_refs` counts only the places that give the live store's location, so a how-to may still name the path a store moves from.
- WHEN `(Q=$(printf '\140'); echo "store_branch=$(grep -c 'factory-store' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') migrate=$(grep -c 'factory store migrate' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') ffdx=$(grep -c -- '-ffdx' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') premove=$(grep -c 'from before the move' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') old_cost=$(tr '\n' ' ' < README.md | grep -c 'committing the store to the same branch') old_refs=$(grep -c "\.factory/state/\(log\|tickets\)\|(${Q}\.factory/state/${Q})\|at ${Q}\.factory/state/${Q}" README.md)")`
- THEN it prints `store_branch=1 migrate=1 ffdx=1 premove=1 old_cost=0 old_refs=0`

#### Scenario: The store-branch change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The planner labels checks per sub-ticket and may list tests an earlier sibling added
Every copy of the planner prompt (the `docs/design.md` §4 block, `docs/prompts/04-planner.md`, `factory/prompts/planner.md`) SHALL tell the planner to label each check against the sub-ticket's own base, to name interim tests, and to list a sibling-added test as `` `<file>[::<test>]` (added by <sibling ID>): <reason> ``; it MUST no longer say to label checks "the same way", and the design block and its `docs/prompts/` copy SHALL stay byte-identical.

#### Scenario: Every planner copy labels per sub-ticket and lists sibling tests
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-planner.txt; sed -n '/^## 4\. Planner/,/^## 5\. /p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/04-planner.md factory/prompts/planner.md; do echo "own=$(grep -c "against this sub-ticket's own base" $f) sibling=$(grep -cF '(added by <sibling ID>)' $f) interim=$(grep -c '^  Interim tests: ' $f) copied=$(grep -c 'labelled NEW or REGRESSION the same way' $f)"; done; cmp -s $X docs/prompts/04-planner.md && echo verbatim || echo differs)`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `own=1 sibling=1 interim=1 copied=0`, then `verbatim`

### Requirement: The spec writer lists the tests a decision overturns, and the critic checks for one left off
Every copy of the spec writer prompt SHALL carry the RULES bullet that starts `- Tests a decision overturns: `, and every copy of the critic prompt SHALL say under rubric 1 that a test pinning the old behaviour and `missing from "Tests to change" is a finding`.

#### Scenario: Every spec writer and critic copy carries the decision-overturns rule
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-sw.txt; for h in '2\. Spec writer' '3\. Spec critic'; do sed -n "/^## $h/,/^## [0-9]/p" docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p"; done > $X; echo "design: writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' $X) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' $X)"; echo "docs/prompts: writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md)"; echo "factory/prompts: writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' factory/prompts/spec_writer.md) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' factory/prompts/critic.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design: writer=1 critic=1`, then `docs/prompts: writer=1 critic=1`, then `factory/prompts: writer=1 critic=1`

### Requirement: The preamble and the code reviewer accept a checked sibling entry
Every copy of the preamble SHALL allow an existing test listed `in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling`, and every copy of the code reviewer prompt SHALL not block a test `the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling`.

#### Scenario: Every preamble and reviewer copy accepts a sibling entry
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-pr.txt; for h in 'Shared preamble' '6\. Code reviewer'; do sed -n "/^## $h/,/^## [0-9A-Z]/p" docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p"; done > $X; echo "design: guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' $X) review=$(grep -c 'or the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling' $X)"; echo "docs/prompts: guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' docs/prompts/00-preamble.md) review=$(grep -c 'or the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling' docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md)"; echo "factory/prompts: guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' factory/prompts/preamble.md) review=$(grep -c 'or the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling' factory/prompts/reviewer.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design: guard=1 review=1`, then `docs/prompts: guard=1 review=1`, then `factory/prompts: guard=1 review=1`

### Requirement: Role runs receive the new rules
The system prompt that `run start` writes for a planner, spec writer and critic run SHALL contain that role's new rule and the new preamble sentence.

#### Scenario: Planner, spec writer and critic runs get the new rules in their system prompts
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s; for i in 1 2 3; do printf "# F$i\n\nDo x.\n" > $T/req$i.md; bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req$i.md >/dev/null; done; bin/factory ticket set T-0001 status=ready-for-planner >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0002 status=ready-for-spec-writer >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0003 status=ready-for-critic >/dev/null; for p in planner:T-0001 spec_writer:T-0002 critic:T-0003; do bin/factory run start --role ${p%%:*} --ticket ${p##*:} >/dev/null 2>&1; done; P=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-planner/system-prompt.txt); W=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-spec_writer/system-prompt.txt); C=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-critic/system-prompt.txt); echo "planner own=$(grep -c "against this sub-ticket's own base" $P) sibling=$(grep -cF '(added by <sibling ID>)' $P) guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' $P) writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' $W) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' $C)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `planner own=1 sibling=1 guard=1 writer=1 critic=1`

### Requirement: The documents record the sibling-tests check
`docs/design.md` SHALL describe the check in a paragraph that starts `**Tests a sibling added.**`, in piece 8 and in the spec approval gate row, and SHALL no longer call the gate's list the only authorization to alter an existing test; `dev/build-harness.spec.md` SHALL name the `BLOCKED from harness` refusal; `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain an entry for issue #40 and stay numbered without a gap; `README.md` SHALL describe the check and the new `--ruling` case; and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design doc and build spec describe the check
- WHEN `(echo "piece8=$(grep '^| 8 |' docs/design.md | grep -c 'added by that sibling') gate=$(grep '^| Spec approval |' docs/design.md | grep -c 'a test an earlier sibling added') stale=$(grep -c 'which is the only authorization to alter an existing test' docs/design.md) check=$(grep -c '^\*\*Tests a sibling added\.\*\*.*BLOCKED from harness:' docs/design.md) build=$(grep -c 'BLOCKED from harness' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `piece8=1 gate=1 stale=0 check=1 build=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records issue 40's change without a numbering gap
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #40 ' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e 'own base' -e 'added by' -e 'BLOCKED from harness' -e 'Decision' -e 'critic rubric 1' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: README describes the sibling tests check and its ruling
- WHEN `(echo "built=$(grep -c '^- \*\*Sibling tests check\.\*\*' README.md) ruling=$(grep '^| \*\*Unstick\*\*' README.md | grep -c 'a test no merged sibling added')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `built=1 ruling=1`

#### Scenario: The sibling-tests change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the declared-path rule
The "## 5. Implementer" and "## 7. Verifier" blocks of `docs/design.md` SHALL carry the declared-path rule and stay verbatim copies of `docs/prompts/05-implementer.md` and `docs/prompts/07-verifier.md`. The run copies under `factory/prompts/` SHALL differ from those files only by the fills they had on `main`. The code reviewer and preamble copies MUST NOT change. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for issue #49, numbered without a gap, and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design blocks and their copies carry the rule and stay in step
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); Q=$(printf '\140\140\140'); for r in "5. Implementer|05-implementer.md|implementer" "7.

- THEN it prints exactly `implementer copy=SAME rule=1 fill=unchanged`, then `verifier copy=SAME rule=1 fill=unchanged`. `copy=SAME`: the design block equals its `docs/prompts/` file. `rule=1`: that file carries the rule. `fill=unchanged`: the run copy under `factory/prompts/` differs from the documented copy only where it did on `main`.

#### Scenario: The code reviewer and preamble copies do not change
- WHEN `(echo "changed=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- factory/prompts/reviewer.md factory/prompts/preamble.md docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md docs/prompts/00-preamble.md | grep -c .)")`

#### Scenario: The changelog records the declared-path rule in a contiguous entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep -E '^[0-9]+\. ' docs/changelog.md | grep -F '#49' | grep -c 'ESCALATIONS')`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`

#### Scenario: The declared-path change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the small-change lane
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for this change as its last numbered entry, numbered without a gap. `docs/design.md`, `dev/build-harness.spec.md` and `README.md` SHALL describe the whole-spec sub-ticket and gate-command paths. No prompt copy SHALL change, and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the small-change lane as its last entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -oF -e 'paths' -e SKIPPED -e 'plan whole-spec' -e NEEDS-SPLIT -e seams | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: The design doc, build spec and README describe both skips, and no prompt copy changes
- WHEN `(echo "design=$(grep -c 'whole-spec' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') gate=$(grep '^| 11 | Gate runner' docs/design.md | grep -c 'SKIPPED') build=$(grep -c 'plan whole-spec' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') readme=$(grep -c 'plan whole-spec' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') skipped=$(grep -c 'SKIPPED' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') stale=$(grep -c 'The build workflow runs the planner, which' README.md) prompts=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts agents | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design=1 gate=1 build=1 readme=1 skipped=1 stale=0 prompts=0`

#### Scenario: The small-change lane adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: Every role is told to wait for its own commands
Every copy of the shared preamble SHALL carry the bullet that starts `- Run every command in the foreground and wait for it to finish.` and says `Never end your turn while a command you started is still running`. The design block and both files MUST stay byte-identical, and every role run's system prompt SHALL carry the bullet.

#### Scenario: Every preamble copy carries the wait rule and the copies stay identical
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-pre.txt; sed -n '/^## Shared preamble/,/^## [0-9]/p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/00-preamble.md factory/prompts/preamble.md; do echo "fg=$(grep -c '^- Run every command in the foreground and wait for it to finish\.$' $f) end=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $f | tr -s ' ' | grep -c 'Never end your turn while a command you started is still running')"; done; cmp -s $X docs/prompts/00-preamble.md && cmp -s docs/prompts/00-preamble.md factory/prompts/preamble.md && echo verbatim || echo differs)`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `fg=1 end=1`, then `verbatim`

#### Scenario: Implementer, reviewer and verifier run prompts carry the wait rule, and only the reviewer's carries the judge-the-diff rule
Needs the GIVEN block of "Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh && for r in implementer reviewer verifier; do P=$(prompt $r); echo "$r fg=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'Never end your turn while a command you started is still running') judge=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'Do not run the test suite or the gate commands')"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer fg=1 judge=0`, `reviewer fg=1 judge=1`, `verifier fg=1 judge=0`, one per line

### Requirement: The code reviewer judges the diff and leaves the suite and the gate to the verifier
Every copy of the code reviewer prompt SHALL say `Do not run the test suite or the gate commands: the verifier runs them on the same head`, and SHALL allow a narrow command that confirms a specific finding. No existing line of that prompt MAY be removed, and the verifier prompt MUST NOT change. The reviewer's composed input MUST NOT list the gate commands, while the implementer's and the verifier's inputs still SHALL.

#### Scenario: Every reviewer copy carries the rule, keeps every existing line, and the verifier prompt is unchanged
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-rev.txt; T=$(mktemp -d); sed -n '/^## 6\. Code reviewer/,/^## 7\. /p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md factory/prompts/reviewer.md; do J=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $f | tr -s ' '); echo "judge=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'Do not run the test suite or the gate commands: the verifier runs them on the same head') narrow=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'You may run a narrow command to confirm a specific finding')"; done; git show main:factory/prompts/reviewer.md > $T/a; git show main:docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md > $T/b; echo "copy=$(cmp -s $X docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md && echo SAME || echo DIFF) fill=$([ "$(diff factory/prompts/reviewer.md docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md | grep '^[<>]')" = "$(diff $T/a $T/b | grep '^[<>]')" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed) removed=$(git diff main...HEAD -- docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md factory/prompts/reviewer.md | grep -v '^---' | grep -c '^-') verifier_changed=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts/07-verifier.md factory/prompts/verifier.md | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `judge=1 narrow=1`, then `copy=SAME fill=unchanged removed=0 verifier_changed=0`

#### Scenario: The reviewer's input no longer hands it the gate commands, and the implementer's and verifier's still do
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "A reviewer that ends its turn waiting on its own commands is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT beside the verifier's passing rows" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-checks.sh && for r in reviewer verifier implementer; do [ $r = implementer ] && bin/factory ticket set T-0001.1 status=ready-for-implementer 'in_flight=[]' >/dev/null; R=$(bin/factory run start --role $r --ticket T-0001.1 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'); bin/factory run compose ${R:-none} >/dev/null 2>&1; I=$FACTORY_STATE/runs/${R:-none}/input.md; echo "$r gates=$(grep -c 'Gate commands (run each from your worktree' $I 2>/dev/null) told=$(grep -c 'The verifier runs the gate commands on this head; you do not run them' $I 2>/dev/null)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `reviewer gates=0 told=1`, `verifier gates=1 told=0`, `implementer gates=1 told=0`, one per line

### Requirement: The documents record the empty-output route
`docs/design.md` SHALL state the EMPTY-OUTPUT rule and its two routing-table rows, and SHALL list a second EMPTY-OUTPUT among the park reasons. `dev/build-harness.spec.md` SHALL describe EMPTY-OUTPUT and `run last-message`, and SHALL no longer describe a KILLED condition or seam. `README.md` SHALL no longer say that a run is parked for exceeding a budget, and SHALL describe the empty-output retry. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain an entry for issue #41, numbered without a gap. The change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design doc states the EMPTY-OUTPUT rule, its rows and its park
- WHEN `(echo "rule=$(grep -c '^- A role run that ends without writing its output is EMPTY-OUTPUT' docs/design.md) rows=$(grep -c '^| Any role | EMPTY-OUTPUT' docs/design.md) parks=$(grep '^- A non-empty ESCALATIONS line' docs/design.md | grep -c 'a second EMPTY-OUTPUT in a row') kill=$(grep -c 'never recorded as a budget kill' docs/design.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `rule=1 rows=2 parks=1 kill=1`

#### Scenario: The build spec describes EMPTY-OUTPUT and no longer a KILLED condition
- WHEN `(echo "stale=$(grep -c 'KILLED condition\|KILLED seam' dev/build-harness.spec.md) empty=$(grep -c 'EMPTY-OUTPUT' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') note=$(grep -c 'run last-message' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `stale=0 empty=1 note=1`

#### Scenario: README drops the budget park and describes the empty-output retry
- WHEN `(echo "budget=$(grep -c 'exceeding its budget\|over budget' README.md) built=$(grep -c '^- \*\*Empty output\.\*\*' README.md) unstick=$(grep '^| \*\*Unstick\*\*' README.md | grep -c 'ended without output twice')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `budget=0 built=1 unstick=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records issue 41 without a numbering gap
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #41 ' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e EMPTY-OUTPUT -e foreground -e 'last message' -e 're-dispatched once' -e 'gate commands' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: The empty-output change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The spec writer and the critic carry the turn-economy rules
Every copy of the spec writer prompt SHALL tell it to batch independent reads and commands, read line ranges once grep has found them, keep long output in a scratch file, and write the spec in as few writes as it can. Every copy of the critic prompt SHALL carry the same reading rules, its minimum spot-check, a rule that it runs no test suite, the rule for picking an acceptance command, a sentence allowing a small experiment in its scratch directory to confirm a finding, and the rule that turns a claim needing a suite run or a build of the change into a finding or a question; it MUST NOT cap a claim at a number of paths and commands or forbid a clone, worktree or prototype. Each design block MUST stay byte-identical to its `docs/prompts/` copy, and each run copy SHALL differ from it only as it did on `main`.

#### Scenario: Every critic copy drops the cap and the no-build rule and keeps the rest; every writer copy keeps its rules
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); Q=$(printf '\140\140\140'); printf '%s\n' 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn' 'read that line range, not the whole file' 'to a file in your scratch directory and grep or tail it' > $T/both; { cat $T/both; echo 'Write the spec in as few writes as you can'; } > $T/spec_writer; { cat $T/both; printf '%s\n' 'Spot-check at least 2 cited paths and 1 acceptance command yourself' 'Run no test suite' 'Pick an acceptance command that runs no test suite' 'small experiment in your scratch directory' 'is a finding for the writer, or a question'; } > $T/critic; printf '%s\n' 'Ground any one claim' 'build nothing' 'no clone, worktree or prototype' > $T/gone; for r in "2.

- THEN it prints exactly `spec_writer copy=SAME doc=4/4 run=4/4 gone=0 fill=unchanged`, then `critic copy=SAME doc=8/8 run=8/8 gone=0 fill=unchanged`. `doc` and `run` count the kept or added phrases found in the documented copy and the run copy, each joined into one line so a phrase may wrap; `gone` counts the removed phrases found in either.

### Requirement: Spec writer and critic runs receive the turn-economy rules
The system prompt that `run start` writes for a spec writer run SHALL contain the writer's turn-economy rule. The one it writes for a critic run SHALL contain the critic's reading rules, its no-suite rule and the sentence allowing a small scratch experiment, and MUST NOT contain the per-claim cap or the no-build rule.

#### Scenario: A critic run's prompt has the no-suite rule and the scratch allowance, and no cap or build ban
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s; for i in 1 2; do printf "# F$i\n\nDo x.\n" > $T/req$i.md; bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req$i.md >/dev/null; done; bin/factory ticket set T-0001 status=ready-for-spec-writer >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0002 status=ready-for-critic >/dev/null; bin/factory run start --role spec_writer --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1; bin/factory run start --role critic --ticket T-0002 >/dev/null 2>&1; W=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $FACTORY_STATE/runs/run-0001-spec_writer/system-prompt.txt | tr -s ' '); C=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $FACTORY_STATE/runs/run-0002-critic/system-prompt.txt | tr -s ' '); echo "spec_writer batch=$(printf "%s" "$W" | grep -c 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn') writes=$(printf "%s" "$W" | grep -c 'Write the spec in as few writes as you can')"; echo "critic batch=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn') suite=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Run no test suite') scratch=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'small experiment in your scratch directory') cap=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Ground any one claim') build=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'build nothing')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `spec_writer batch=1 writes=1`, then `critic batch=1 suite=1 scratch=1 cap=0 build=0`

### Requirement: Nothing else in the two prompts changes
The spec writer prompt copies SHALL stay as #73 left them at `05cf8f9`. In the critic prompt copies, everything before the PROCESS section and everything from ANTI-GOODHARTING on SHALL stay byte for byte as on `main`. No other file under `docs/prompts/`, `factory/prompts/` or `agents/` SHALL change.

#### Scenario: The writer prompt is as #73 left it, and only the critic's PROCESS changes
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); n=0; for x in "docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md|1,/^PROCESS\$/p" "docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md|/^ANTI-GOODHARTING/,\$p" "factory/prompts/critic.md|1,/^PROCESS\$/p" "factory/prompts/critic.md|/^ANTI-GOODHARTING/,\$p"; do f=${x%%|*}; s=${x#*|}; git show main:$f | sed -n "$s" > $T/a; sed -n "$s" $f > $T/b; [ -s $T/a ] || n=$((n+100)); cmp -s $T/a $T/b || { n=$((n+1)); echo "changed: $f $s"; }; done; echo "sections_changed=$n writer=$(git diff --name-only 05cf8f9 HEAD -- docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md factory/prompts/spec_writer.md | grep -c .) others=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts agents | grep -vxF -e docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md -e factory/prompts/critic.md | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints only `sections_changed=0 writer=0 others=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the turn-economy change
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #73, numbered without a gap. `docs/principles.md` principle 2 SHALL name the critic's no-suite rule among its mechanisms, SHALL no longer say the critic builds nothing, and SHALL say part B.2 is done by #41 for the code reviewer and by #73 for the critic.

#### Scenario: Principle 2 names the critic's no-suite rule and no longer its build ban
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; P=$(sed -n '/^### 2\. /,/^### 3\. /p' docs/principles.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "entries73=$(grep -c '^[0-9]*\. After issue #73 ' docs/changelog.md) implemented=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'runs no test suite (#73') builds=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'builds nothing') status=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'done by #41 for the code reviewer and by #73 for the critic')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `CONTIGUOUS`, then `entries73=1 implemented=1 builds=0 status=1`

### Requirement: The documents record the critic revert
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for issue #74 as its last numbered entry, numbered without a gap, that records the replay result and the two removed rules. The Spiking section of `docs/principles.md` SHALL no longer bound the critic to two paths and one command or say it does not build, SHALL say the critic may run a small scratch check, SHALL say vetting a whole approach belongs to the spec writer or a spike, and SHALL record the replay. The change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the revert as its last entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -oF -e '#74' -e replay -e 'per-claim cap' -e 'no-build rule' -e 'no test suite' -e UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR -e brace-list | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `7`

#### Scenario: The Spiking section allows a small scratch check and records the replay
- WHEN `(X=$(sed -n '/^## Spiking/,$p' docs/principles.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "bound=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'two paths, one command') nobuild=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'it does not build') scratch=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'small scratch check') whole=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'vetting a whole approach belongs to the spec writer') replay=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'replay')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `bound=0 nobuild=0 scratch=1 whole=1 replay=1`

#### Scenario: The critic revert adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the capability index
The triage prompt's design block, its `docs/prompts/` copy and the runtime prompt SHALL each carry the `Capabilities:` output line. `docs/design.md`, `dev/build-harness.spec.md` and the README's Triage, Spec writer and Spec critic rows MUST describe the capability index. `docs/changelog.md` MUST have an entry for issue #75, with no whitespace error in the change.

#### Scenario: The prompt copies, design, build spec, README and changelog name the capability index
- WHEN `(echo "docs-copy=$(grep -c '^Capabilities:' docs/prompts/01-triage.md) runtime=$(grep -c '^Capabilities:' factory/prompts/triage.md) changelog=$(grep -c '^[0-9]*\. After issue #75 ' docs/changelog.md) design=$(grep -q 'capability index' docs/design.md && echo y || echo n) build-spec=$(grep -q 'capability index' dev/build-harness.spec.md && echo y || echo n) readme=$(grep -E '^\| (Triage|Spec writer|Spec critic) \(' README.md | grep -c 'capability index')"; git diff --check main...HEAD && echo whitespace=ok)`
- THEN it prints exactly `docs-copy=1 runtime=1 changelog=1 design=y build-spec=y readme=3`, then `whitespace=ok`

## Current truth: harness-suite

# harness-suite

## Requirements

### Requirement: The harness suite runs mid-edit without loosening the lock
The harness's own test suite SHALL pass in a checkout that has an uncommitted edit under a harness path, and a store command on an instance's own store run from such a checkout MUST still be refused.

#### Scenario: The harness suite passes with an uncommitted harness edit
The command gives pytest its own temporary directory under `/tmp`, because four existing tests need one outside every repository and instance. Run it as written, whatever `TMPDIR` the caller has set; it removes that directory when it ends.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && P=$(mktemp -d /tmp/t0023-suite.XXXXXX) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && echo '# uncommitted edit' >> $T/c/factory/status.py && cd $T/c && TMPDIR=$P .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | tail -1; rm -rf "$P")`
- THEN it prints one line reporting a number of passed tests and no `failed` or `error`

#### Scenario: The uncommitted-edit refusal still holds on an instance's own store
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && echo '# uncommitted edit' >> $T/c/factory/status.py && git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $T/c/bin/factory init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && $T/c/bin/factory config >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$?"; head -1 $T/err | grep -o 'has uncommitted changes:$')`
- THEN it prints `exit=2`, then `has uncommitted changes:`

## Current truth: human-resolution

# human-resolution

## Requirements

### Requirement: A ruling returns a BLOCKED sub-ticket to its implementer
`factory resolve <id> --ruling F` on a park whose reason starts with `BLOCKED` MUST write F as the ticket's next ruling, return it to `ready-for-implementer` at the same round, and the next implementer input SHALL contain the ruling.

#### Scenario: A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.

## Current truth: live-store-guard

# live-store-guard

## Requirements

### Requirement: Unmarked writes to a live store are refused while a role run is in flight there
While any run is in flight on an instance's own store, every `factory` command on that store except `ticket show`, `ticket join`, `results show`, `config`, `status parse`, `log tail` and `paths` (and any command given `--accept-harness`) MUST be refused with exit 2, writing nothing to the store, the instance or the repository, unless its environment has `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1`; the refusal SHALL name a throwaway `FACTORY_STATE` and SHALL NOT name the marker.

#### Scenario: Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.

- THEN it prints exactly `accept=2 store=unchanged`

### Requirement: Writes from inside a store's run directories or code checkouts are refused, marked or not
Every `factory` command on an instance's own store except the read-only list above MUST be refused with exit 2, writing nothing, when the caller's directory lies under that store's `runs/` or `worktrees/`, whether or not its environment has `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` and whether or not any run is in flight.

#### Scenario: Marked writes from a run's scratch directory or a worktree directory are refused, init included
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once.

- THEN it prints exactly `idle=1 new=2 decision=2 store=unchanged`

### Requirement: Reads, marked commands from outside the store, throwaway stores and idle stores stay open
While a run is in flight on the live store, the read-only commands SHALL succeed from anywhere, a command with `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` run from outside the store's `runs/` and `worktrees/` SHALL succeed as before, and a command on a throwaway store (`FACTORY_STATE` naming another store) SHALL NOT be fenced from any directory; with no run in flight, unmarked writes from outside those directories SHALL succeed as before.

- THEN it prints exactly `new=0 decision=0`

### Requirement: The marker does not lift the harness lock
A command with `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` on an instance's own store MUST still be refused by the harness lock's uncommitted-edit check, with exit 2 and nothing written, whether or not a run is in flight.

#### Scenario: A marked write from a harness checkout with an uncommitted edit is still refused
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $T/c/bin/factory init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md && $T/c/bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null && $T/c/bin/factory run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null && echo '# uncommitted edit' >> $T/c/factory/status.py && S0=$(find $T/tgt/.factory -type f -exec cksum {} + | sort | cksum) && FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 $T/c/bin/factory decision add T-0001 x >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? lock=$(head -1 $T/err | grep -c 'has uncommitted changes:$') store=$([ "$(find $T/tgt/.factory -type f -exec cksum {} + | sort | cksum)" = "$S0" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `exit=2 lock=1 store=unchanged`

## Current truth: merge-gate

# merge-gate

## Requirements

### Requirement: A store commit does not hold back a merge
On an instance whose store is the checkout of `factory-store`, a store commit made after a sub-ticket's checks SHALL NOT stop `factory merge` from merging that sub-ticket.

#### Scenario: A sub-ticket merges after a store commit
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-gate.sh && git -C .factory/state add -A && git -C .factory/state commit -q -m "store: rows recorded"; $B merge T-0001 >/dev/null 2>$T25/err; echo "exit=$? refused=$(grep -c 'head does not contain main' $T25/err)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=0 refused=0`

### Requirement: A commit to the integration branch still holds back a merge
`factory merge` MUST still refuse, with `head does not contain main`, a sub-ticket whose head does not contain a commit made to the integration branch after its checks.

#### Scenario: A sub-ticket is refused after a code commit to main
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-gate.sh && echo y > y.txt && git add y.txt && git commit -q -m "code on main"; $B merge T-0001 >/dev/null 2>$T25/err; echo "exit=$? refused=$(grep -c 'head does not contain main' $T25/err)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 refused=1`

## Current truth: role-escalations

# role-escalations

## Requirements

### Requirement: The implementer and verifier leave declared protected paths out of ESCALATIONS
The system prompt of every implementer and verifier run SHALL say that a protected path the sub-ticket declares is not an escalation, that the code reviewer lists declared paths once for each head it reviews, that the role may name them but not under ESCALATIONS, and that a protected path the sub-ticket does not declare still goes under ESCALATIONS.

#### Scenario: Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the fixture file written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

```sh

- THEN it prints exactly `implementer declared=1 notunder=1 undeclared=1`, then `verifier declared=1 notunder=1 undeclared=1`

### Requirement: Every role still escalates an undeclared protected path, and the code reviewer still lists declared ones
The system prompts of implementer, code reviewer and verifier runs MUST still carry the preamble's rule to escalate a protected path that the approved spec's Risk section does not declare, and the code reviewer's prompt MUST still carry check 6 unchanged.

#### Scenario: All three run prompts keep the undeclared-path rule and the reviewer keeps check 6
Needs the GIVEN block of "Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh && u="a protected path the approved spec's Risk section does not declare"; for r in implementer reviewer verifier; do echo "$r undeclared=$(prompt $r | grep -cF "$u")"; done; echo "check6=$(prompt reviewer | grep -cF '6. Protected paths touched? If the sub-ticket does not declare them, ESCALATE. If it does, list them under ESCALATIONS')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer undeclared=1`, `reviewer undeclared=1`, `verifier undeclared=1`, `check6=1`, one per line

## Current truth: role-inputs

# role-inputs

## Requirements

### Requirement: The spec writer and critic receive in full only the capabilities their ticket names or their spec cites, and a capability index for the rest
When a ticket's latest finished triage output has a `Capabilities:` line, the spec writer and critic inputs SHALL hold in full only the current-truth capabilities that line names or the spec they work from cites by its `specs/<name>/spec.md` path. They MUST hold, for every other capability, one index line with its absolute spec path and its requirement names, under an instruction that citing a capability's path sends it in full to the critic. The planner SHALL receive no current truth.

#### Scenario: A ticket naming one capability composes inputs with only that capability in full and an index line for each other one
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the fixture file written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

```sh
cat > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0036-store.sh <<'EOF'
# Sourced from the repo root, with $1 the Capabilities line that T-0001's triage output carries
# (empty for none). Builds a throwaway store holding three capabilities, alpha, beta and gamma,
# each with one requirement whose text carries a marker (ALPHA-BODY, BETA-BODY, GAMMA-BODY), and a
# decision log of four lines: OWN-LINE logged against T-0001, BETA-LINE and GAMMA-LINE naming those
# capabilities, OTHER-LINE logged against T-0009 and naming none. T-0001's triage run ends ACCEPT
# with that line. Its spec writer run is composed; the spec it returns changes beta and cites
# `openspec/specs/gamma/spec.md` under Evidence. A critic run is composed on that spec; the spec is
# approved and a planner run is composed. Leaves $S (the store) and the input.md of each run:
# $I (triage), $W (spec writer), $C (critic), $P (planner).

- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0036-store.sh 'Capabilities: beta'; for v in W C P; do eval f=\$$v; y() { grep -F -- "$S/openspec/specs/$1/spec.md" $f | grep -qF -- "The $1 part works" && echo y || echo n; }; echo "$v: alpha=$(grep -c ALPHA-BODY $f) beta=$(grep -c BETA-BODY $f) gamma=$(grep -c GAMMA-BODY $f) alpha-index=$(y alpha) gamma-index=$(y gamma) cites=$(grep -cF 'sends that capability in full to the critic' $f)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `W: alpha=0 beta=1 gamma=0 alpha-index=y gamma-index=y cites=1`, then `C: alpha=0 beta=1 gamma=1 alpha-index=y gamma-index=n cites=1`, then `P: alpha=0 beta=0 gamma=0 alpha-index=n gamma-index=n cites=0`. The writer gets beta, which triage named. The critic also gets gamma, whose path the spec cites. A capability's index line holds both its spec's absolute path and its requirement name. The writer's and critic's capability index carries its instruction paragraph once; the planner has no capability index.

### Requirement: The spec writer, critic and planner receive in full only the decisions of their ticket and its capabilities, and a decision index for the rest
When a ticket's latest finished triage output has a `Capabilities:` line, the spec writer, critic and planner inputs SHALL hold in full only the decision-log lines logged against that ticket or naming a capability that role receives in full. They MUST hold one index line per ticket whose lines were left out, and the absolute path of `decisions.md` in an instruction to read a ticket's decisions with `grep`.

#### Scenario: Decisions of other tickets and capabilities reach each role as one index line per ticket
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ticket naming one capability composes inputs with only that capability in full and an index line for each other one" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0036-store.sh 'Capabilities: beta'; for v in W C P; do eval f=\$$v; echo "$v: own=$(grep -c OWN-LINE $f) beta-line=$(grep -c BETA-LINE $f) gamma-line=$(grep -c GAMMA-LINE $f) other=$(grep -c OTHER-LINE $f) indexed=$(grep -v -- '-LINE' $f | grep -o 'T-000[789]' | sort -u | paste -sd, -) log-path=$(grep -qF "$S/decisions.md" $f && echo y || echo n) grep-cmd=$(grep -cF "grep ' <ticket id> ' $S/decisions.md" $f)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `W: own=1 beta-line=1 gamma-line=0 other=0 indexed=T-0008,T-0009 log-path=y grep-cmd=1`, then `C: own=1 beta-line=1 gamma-line=1 other=0 indexed=T-0009 log-path=y grep-cmd=1`, then `P: own=1 beta-line=1 gamma-line=1 other=0 indexed=T-0009 log-path=y grep-cmd=1`. Each role's decision index carries its `grep` instruction once, with the log's absolute path.

### Requirement: A ticket whose triage output names no capabilities receives today's inputs
When a ticket's latest finished triage output has no `Capabilities:` line, the spec writer and critic SHALL receive every current-truth capability in full, and all three roles SHALL receive the whole decision log, as before this change.

#### Scenario: Without a Capabilities line every capability and every decision reach the writer, critic and planner
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ticket naming one capability composes inputs with only that capability in full and an index line for each other one" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0036-store.sh ''; for v in W C P; do eval f=\$$v; echo "$v: alpha=$(grep -c ALPHA-BODY $f) beta=$(grep -c BETA-BODY $f) gamma=$(grep -c GAMMA-BODY $f) own=$(grep -c OWN-LINE $f) beta-line=$(grep -c BETA-LINE $f) gamma-line=$(grep -c GAMMA-LINE $f) other=$(grep -c OTHER-LINE $f)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `W: alpha=1 beta=1 gamma=1 own=1 beta-line=1 gamma-line=1 other=1`, then `C: alpha=1 beta=1 gamma=1 own=1 beta-line=1 gamma-line=1 other=1`, then `P: alpha=0 beta=0 gamma=0 own=1 beta-line=1 gamma-line=1 other=1`

#### Scenario: The harness suite passes with the new inputs
- WHEN `(export HOME="$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P)"; uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "suite=$?")`
- THEN it prints exactly `suite=0`

### Requirement: Triage receives the capability index and is asked to name the capabilities a request touches
A triage run's input SHALL hold one capability index line per current-truth capability, with its absolute spec path and its requirement names, and no capability body or decision. Its system prompt MUST ask for a `Capabilities:` output line.

#### Scenario: A triage input lists every capability by path and requirement, and its prompt asks for the Capabilities line
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ticket naming one capability composes inputs with only that capability in full and an index line for each other one" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0036-store.sh 'Capabilities: beta'; f=$I; y() { grep -F -- "$S/openspec/specs/$1/spec.md" $f | grep -qF -- "The $1 part works" && echo y || echo n; }; echo "triage: alpha-index=$(y alpha) beta-index=$(y beta) gamma-index=$(y gamma) bodies=$(grep -c -- '-BODY' $f) decisions=$(grep -c -- '-LINE' $f) asks=$(grep -c '^Capabilities:' $(dirname $f)/system-prompt.txt)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `triage: alpha-index=y beta-index=y gamma-index=y bodies=0 decisions=0 asks=1`

## Current truth: store-setup

# store-setup

## Requirements

### Requirement: Run records are exempt from whitespace checks
A store that `init` or `run start` has touched MUST hold a `.gitattributes` with the line `runs/** -whitespace`, so that `git diff --check` SHALL NOT report run records while it still reports every other store file.

#### Scenario: Run records in a store pass whitespace checks and other store files do not
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && git init -q -b main $T/r && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && FACTORY_STATE=$T/r/store bin/factory init >/dev/null && git -C $T/r add -A && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q -m store && mkdir -p $T/r/store/runs/run-0001-verifier && printf 'context \n x\n' > $T/r/store/runs/run-0001-verifier/diff.patch && git -C $T/r add -A && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q -m record && git -C $T/r diff --check HEAD~1 HEAD >/dev/null; echo "runs=$?"; printf 'x \n' > $T/r/store/notes.md && git -C $T/r add -A && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q -m notes && git -C $T/r diff --check HEAD~1 HEAD >/dev/null; echo "other=$?")`
- THEN it prints `runs=0`, then `other=2`

#### Scenario: A run start adds the whitespace rule to an existing store
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && bin/factory run start --role planner --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null && echo "rule=$(cat $FACTORY_STATE/.gitattributes 2>/dev/null | grep -cxF 'runs/** -whitespace')")`
- THEN it prints `rule=1`

### Requirement: No half instance, and a missing briefing refuses
`factory init` MUST refuse with exit 2, writing nothing, when it would create an instance while `FACTORY_STATE` names another store; `run compose` MUST refuse with exit 2, writing no input, when the instance has no `context.md`.

#### Scenario: init refuses to create an instance on a throwaway store and writes nothing
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && FACTORY_STATE=$T/s $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? instance=$([ -e $T/tgt/.factory ] && echo written || echo none) store=$([ -e $T/s ] && echo written || echo none) names_state=$(grep -c FACTORY_STATE $T/err)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 instance=none store=none names_state=1`

#### Scenario: A missing briefing refuses the compose with exit 2
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && rm .factory/context.md && export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md && $B ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null && $B run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null && $B run compose run-0001-triage >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? input=$([ -e $T/s/runs/run-0001-triage/input.md ] && echo written || echo none) names_context=$(grep -c 'context.md' $T/err)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 input=none names_context=1`

### Requirement: Relative environment paths resolve from the caller's directory
A relative `FACTORY_STATE`, `FACTORY_INSTANCE` or `FACTORY_REPO` MUST resolve against the directory the command was run from; an absolute value SHALL be used as given.

#### Scenario: Relative FACTORY_STATE, FACTORY_INSTANCE and FACTORY_REPO resolve against the caller's directory
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; F=$(cd tests/factory/fixtures/instance && pwd -P); s=$(cd $T && FACTORY_INSTANCE=$F FACTORY_STATE=rel/store $B paths | tail -1); i=$(cd $F/.. && FACTORY_INSTANCE=instance $B paths | tail -1); r=$(cd $T && FACTORY_INSTANCE=$F FACTORY_REPO=rel $B paths | tail -1); echo "state=$(echo "$s" | grep -cF "\"state\": \"$T/rel/store\"") instance=$(echo "$i" | grep -cF "\"instance\": \"$F\"") repo=$(echo "$r" | grep -cF "\"state\": \"$T/rel/.factory/state\"")")`
- THEN it prints `state=1 instance=1 repo=1`

#### Scenario: An absolute FACTORY_STATE is used as given
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; F=$(cd tests/factory/fixtures/instance && pwd -P); cd / && echo "absolute=$(FACTORY_INSTANCE=$F FACTORY_STATE=$T/abs $B paths | tail -1 | grep -cF "\"state\": \"$T/abs\"")")`
- THEN it prints `absolute=1`

### Requirement: A new instance's store is a checkout of its own branch
`factory init` SHALL create a missing own store as a git worktree of branch `factory-store`, which the integration checkout does not see. It SHALL check that branch out when it already exists locally or on exactly one remote, so that a store commit never moves the integration branch.

#### Scenario: init creates the store on the factory-store branch, out of the integration checkout's sight
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "branch=$(git -C .factory/state symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>/dev/null) seen_by_main=$(git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all | grep -c '^?? .factory/state/')")`
- THEN it prints `branch=factory-store seen_by_main=0`

#### Scenario: init on a clone restores the store from the pushed branch
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); B=$PWD/bin/factory; export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=f GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=f@x GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=f GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=f@x; git init -q -b main $T/src && cd $T/src && git commit -q --allow-empty -m init && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && git add -A && git commit -q -m instance && git -C .factory/state add -A && git -C .factory/state commit -q -m "store: first" && git clone -q $T/src $T/c && cd $T/c && rm -rf .factory/state && $B init >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$? branch=$(git -C .factory/state symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>/dev/null) restored=$(ls .factory/state/decisions.md 2>/dev/null | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=0 branch=factory-store restored=1`

### Requirement: init refuses when more than one remote carries the store branch
`factory init` MUST refuse with exit 2, creating no store and no local branch, when the own store is missing, no local `factory-store` exists and more than one remote carries it; the refusal MUST name each `<remote>/factory-store`.

#### Scenario: init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both
- GIVEN the three fixture files written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown. Every later scenario of this change that names them reuses them.

- THEN it prints `exit=2 store=none local_branch=0 names=1,1`

### Requirement: init refuses to run from inside the store checkout
`factory init`, run with `FACTORY_INSTANCE` unset from a directory whose git top level is a checkout of `factory-store`, or is the store of the instance found from that directory or a checkout of the same repository inside that store, MUST refuse with exit 2 and write nothing, whichever commit the store has checked out, so that it never creates an instance inside the live store; other commands run from there SHALL still find the live instance, and `init` in a separate repository under the store SHALL still create that repository's instance.

#### Scenario: init from a scratch directory inside the store checkout refuses and leaves the store unchanged
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-b1.sh && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T25/r.md && $B ticket new --file $T25/r.md >/dev/null && $B run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1 && git -C .factory/state status --porcelain --untracked-files=all > $T25/before && cd .factory/state/runs/run-0001-triage/scratch && $B init --repo-name x >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$? phantom=$([ -e $T25/tgt/.factory/state/.factory ] && echo written || echo none) store=$(git -C $T25/tgt/.factory/state status --porcelain --untracked-files=all | cmp -s $T25/before - && echo unchanged || echo changed)"; echo "found=$($B ticket show T-0001 2>/dev/null | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 phantom=none store=unchanged`, then `found=ready-for-triage`

#### Scenario: init from the store checkout on a detached HEAD refuses
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.

- THEN it prints `exit=0 instance=written live=ready-for-triage`

### Requirement: init refuses a store path the integration branch has tracked
`factory init` MUST refuse with exit 2, writing nothing and naming the path, when it would create the own store at a path under which the integration branch has ever tracked a file.

#### Scenario: init refuses a once-tracked store path and writes nothing
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); B=$PWD/bin/factory; export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=f GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=f@x GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=f GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=f@x; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && cd $T/tgt && mkdir -p .factory/state && echo old > .factory/state/old.md && git add -A && git commit -q -m "old store" && git rm -q -r .factory/state && git commit -q -m "store removed" && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? instance=$([ -e .factory ] && echo written || echo none) names_path=$(grep -q '\.factory/state' $T/err && echo 1 || echo 0)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 instance=none names_path=1`

### Requirement: store migrate moves a tracked store onto its branch and keeps every record
`factory store migrate --to PATH` on an idle, fully committed own store that is tracked on the integration branch SHALL do all of the following:
- put the store's last committed tree on a new `factory-store` branch, checked out at PATH;
- copy the store's ignored run files to PATH, and verify the copy before removing anything;
- untrack and remove the old path;
- set `state_dir` to PATH, so that later commands use the moved store.

#### Scenario: store migrate carries the store to factory-store at the new path
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-old.sh && mkdir -p .factory/state/runs/run-0001-triage/scratch && echo n > .factory/state/runs/run-0001-triage/scratch/n.txt && $B store migrate --to .factory/store >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$?"; echo "branch=$(git -C .factory/store symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>/dev/null) same_tree=$([ "$(git rev-parse -q --verify 'factory-store^{tree}')" = "$(git rev-parse $PRE:.factory/state)" ] && echo yes || echo no) scratch=$(cat .factory/store/runs/run-0001-triage/scratch/n.txt 2>/dev/null) old=$([ -e .factory/state ] && echo kept || echo gone) main_tracks=$(git ls-files .factory/state | grep -c .) seen_by_main=$(git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all | grep -c '^?? .factory/store/')"; echo "state_dir=$(sed -n 's/^state_dir: *//p' .factory/instance.yaml) ticket=$($B ticket show T-0001 2>/dev/null | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints `exit=0`, then `branch=factory-store same_tree=yes scratch=n old=gone main_tracks=0 seen_by_main=0`, then `state_dir=.factory/store ticket=ready-for-triage`

### Requirement: store migrate refuses while the store is in use or uncommitted
`factory store migrate` MUST refuse with exit 2, creating no branch and no new path, when a store file is uncommitted or a run is in flight. The refusal MUST name the uncommitted files or the runs in flight.

#### Scenario: store migrate refuses an uncommitted store and a run in flight
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-old.sh && echo edit >> .factory/state/decisions.md; $B store migrate --to .factory/store >/dev/null 2>$T25/e1; echo "uncommitted: exit=$? names=$(grep -c 'decisions.md' $T25/e1) branch=$(git branch --list factory-store | grep -c .)"; git checkout -q -- .factory/state/decisions.md && $B run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1 && git add -A && git commit -q -m "run started"; FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 $B store migrate --to .factory/store >/dev/null 2>$T25/e2; echo "in flight: exit=$? names=$(grep -c 'run-0001-triage' $T25/e2) branch=$(git branch --list factory-store | grep -c .) new=$([ -e .factory/store ] && echo written || echo none)")`
- THEN it prints `uncommitted: exit=2 names=1 branch=0`, then `in flight: exit=2 names=1 branch=0 new=none`

### Requirement: A checkout of an older commit leaves a moved store untouched
After `store migrate`, checking out a commit from before the move in the integration checkout, and then checking out the integration branch again, MUST leave every file of the moved store as it was, uncommitted ones included.

#### Scenario: A checkout of an older commit leaves the moved store untouched
Needs the GIVEN block of "init on a clone with two remotes carrying the store branch refuses and names both" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0025-old.sh && $B store migrate --to .factory/store >/dev/null 2>&1 && git commit -q -a -m "store moved to its branch"; (echo live > .factory/store/live.md) 2>/dev/null; git checkout -q $PRE 2>/dev/null && git checkout -q main 2>/dev/null; echo "live=$(cat .factory/store/live.md 2>/dev/null || echo lost) on=$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)")`
- THEN it prints `live=live on=main`

## Current truth: sub-ticket-planning

# sub-ticket-planning

## Requirements

### Requirement: A later plan's sub-tickets continue the parent's numbering
`factory subticket add` on a parent that already has sub-tickets MUST number the new ones from the next free index, SHALL accept a `Depends on:` line naming an existing sub-ticket, and MUST refuse a plan whose head line reuses an existing sub-ticket's id, writing nothing.

#### Scenario: A later plan's sub-tickets take the next free ids and may depend on a merged sibling
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-closed.sh && printf 'ST-1 / Fix the bypass\nDepends on: T-0001.2\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan2.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan2.md 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | grep -o '"id": "[^"]*"\|"depends_on": \[[^]]*\]'; bin/factory ticket ready-implementers T-0001 | tail -1 | grep -o '"ready": \[[^]]*\]')`
- THEN it prints `"id": "T-0001.3"`, then `"depends_on": ["T-0001.2"]`, then `"ready": ["T-0001.3"]`

#### Scenario: A plan that reuses an existing sub-ticket id is refused and writes nothing
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-closed.sh && printf 'T-0001.1 / Again\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan3.md; bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan3.md >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$? $(ls $FACTORY_STATE/tickets | tr '\n' ' ')")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 T-0001.1.yaml T-0001.2.yaml T-0001.yaml `

### Requirement: A spec that needs one sub-ticket becomes that sub-ticket without a planner run
`factory plan whole-spec <parent>`, on a parent at `ready-for-planner` with an approved spec, MUST act when four conditions hold: the parent has no sub-ticket; it has no earlier planner run; its latest spec-writer run did not end NEEDS-SPLIT; and its approved spec has no `##` or `###` heading, other than a requirement line, naming seams. It MUST then create one sub-ticket `<parent>.1`, ready for its implementer, whose text names every scenario of the approved spec. It MUST log `plan.skipped` with the reason, and report `"planner": "skipped"`. Otherwise it SHALL report `"planner": "needed"` with the reason and write nothing.

#### Scenario: A spec that needs one sub-ticket becomes that sub-ticket without a planner run
- GIVEN the fixture file written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

```sh

#### Scenario: A spec the writer split, or a parent a planner already ran on, still goes to the planner and nothing is written
Needs the GIVEN block of "A spec that needs one sub-ticket becomes that sub-ticket without a planner run" run once. The three cases are a NEEDS-SPLIT spec, a spec with a `### Size and seams` heading, and a parent with an earlier planner run.
- WHEN `(for c in 'NEEDS-SPLIT|' 'READY-FOR-CRITIC|### Size and seams' 'READY-FOR-CRITIC|planner-ran'; do (s=${c%%|*}; x=${c#*|}; [ "$x" = planner-ran ] && e='' || e=$x; . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-plan.sh $s "$e" && if [ "$x" = planner-ran ]; then P=$($B run start --role planner --ticket T-0001 | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'); $B run finish $P --status-override ESCALATE >/dev/null; fi; $B plan whole-spec T-0001 > $T/o 2>&1; echo "exit=$? planner=$(tail -1 $T/o | sed -n 's/.*"planner": "\([a-z]*\)".*/\1/p') subs=$(ls $T/store/tickets | tr '\n' ' ')logged=$($B log tail --event plan.skipped | grep -c .)"); done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `exit=0 planner=needed subs=T-0001.yaml logged=0`, three times

### Requirement: The whole-spec step refuses where a planner run would
`factory plan whole-spec` MUST refuse with exit 2, writing nothing, on a parent that is not at `ready-for-planner`, has a run in flight, or has no approved spec. A refusal for the wrong state SHALL name the state with `not ready-for-planner`.

#### Scenario: The whole-spec step refuses a parent that is not ready for its planner
Needs the GIVEN block of "A spec that needs one sub-ticket becomes that sub-ticket without a planner run" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-plan.sh READY-FOR-CRITIC '' && $B ticket transition T-0001 --to planned --by t >/dev/null && $B plan whole-spec T-0001 >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? named=$(grep -c 'not ready-for-planner' $T/err) subs=$(ls $T/store/tickets | tr '\n' ' ')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `exit=2 named=1 subs=T-0001.yaml `

## Decision log (decisions.md): standing decisions, read-only

2026-10-04 T-0023 `resolve --ruling F` also accepts a park whose reason starts with `BLOCKED`. It writes F as the next `approvals/<id>/ruling-<n>.md` and returns the sub-ticket to `ready-for-implementer` at the same round.
2026-10-04 T-0023 `resolve PARENT --replan F` moves a parked parent whose sub-tickets have all merged to `ready-for-planner`, with F as its next ruling. The planner receives F and plans the fix. Rejected: the requester's `--replan --file <plan>` straight to `planned`. It needs a new routing edge, which the queue policy does not count as small. It would also skip the planner. `dev/build-harness.spec.md` already sends a re-plan through the planner.
2026-10-04 T-0023 On a re-plan, the planner's input lists the parent's existing sub-tickets, each with its title and state. The human's note F therefore needs to say only what to fix. Rejected: asking the human to restate in F what has merged, which the store already knows.
2026-10-04 T-0023 Sub-tickets that a later plan adds take the next free ids under the parent, and their `Depends on:` lines may name the parent's existing sub-tickets. A plan head line that reuses an existing sub-ticket's id is refused. Rejected: honouring explicit non-colliding ids, a second numbering rule that the planner's free-form ids would make ambiguous.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A park reason is never blank. When the clerk relays an empty stderr, the workflows use the refusal's JSON `error`, and failing that `exit <n>, no JSON on stdout` or `exit <n>, no error text`. Rejected: editing each of the 26 reason sites.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A redispatch sets aside a checker's rows only when they did not pass. The reviewer's row is kept when it is `APPROVE`. The verifier and gate rows are kept together when they are `VERIFIED` and `PASS`, because one verifier run writes both. The build then runs only the checkers with no row on that commit. After an implementer run it still runs both. Rejected: a `--roles` flag on redispatch, which no reported case needs.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The store gets a `.gitattributes` holding `runs/** -whitespace`. `init` and every `run start` write it the way they already write `.gitignore`. Rejected: rewriting committed records, and excluding the store path inside each gate command.
2026-10-04 T-0023 `init` refuses, with exit 2 and nothing written, to create an instance while `FACTORY_STATE` names another store. A compose with no `context.md` refuses with exit 2. Rejected: writing every instance piece from a throwaway-store `init`. That contradicts the rule that such a run initialises only that store.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A relative `FACTORY_INSTANCE`, `FACTORY_STATE` or `FACTORY_REPO` resolves against the caller's directory: `FACTORY_CWD`, else the working directory.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The suite's own-store cases that are not about the uncommitted-edit refusal run the CLI through a test-only launcher that stubs that one check. The refusal itself keeps its tests on a clone's real `bin/factory`. Rejected: a switch the production CLI honours, which would loosen the check. Also rejected: running every case from a committed snapshot of the working tree, which changes every assertion that names this checkout's revision or paths.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The suite scenario gives pytest a fresh temporary directory under `/tmp` and removes it afterwards. Four existing tests need a temporary directory outside every repository, and an agent's scratch directory lies inside this one. The scenario states this in its command, so no role has to choose between its scratch rule and a valid run. Rejected: fixing those four tests in this ticket, which is beyond H8 and needs its own design (Out-of-scope observations).
2026-10-04 T-0023 The workflow-script fixes are checked by acceptance scenarios that run the scripts under node with a stub clerk. They get no suite test, because the suite does not need node today and adding that would change what the gate needs.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The change is built as four seams (design.md, "Size and seams"). They share one changelog entry, 51.
2026-10-04 T-0024 T-0024: instance B keeps the spec store created 2026-10-04 by run-0196; its tickets close by archive into current truth (operator)
2026-10-04 T-0024 While a role run is in flight on a live store, a human or runner writes it by prefixing that one command with FACTORY_DISPATCH=1; README documents it and the refusal text never names it (operator)
2026-10-04 T-0024 Instance B keeps the spec store that run-0196 created. Its tickets close by archive into current truth, and `decisions.md` keeps reaching the spec writer, critic and planner. The operator decided this in the first answer to this ticket, and it is already recorded in `decisions.md`. This is a standing decision. This ticket touches README, so it also corrects README's stale "never entered it" line, as that answer directs.
2026-10-04 T-0024 While a role run is in flight on a live store, the operator or a runner session writes it by putting `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` in front of that one command. README documents this. The refusal text never names the marker. The operator decided this in the same answer, and it is already recorded in `decisions.md`. This is a standing decision for every runner session, including the Driver session that runs the Nanobot fork's instance (instance A).
2026-10-04 T-0024 A write is refused, marker or not and run in flight or not, when the caller's directory lies under the own store's `runs/` or `worktrees/`. The operator's gate review asked for this rule. Rejected: applying it only while a run is in flight, because a process a role left running in its run directory would then write freely once the store went idle. Rejected: letting the marker lift it, because the rule exists so that a copied or exported marker does not help from there. This is a standing decision: the operator and runner sessions run store writes from outside the store.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The location rule is checked first, then the marker, then the in-flight list.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The in-flight rule acts only on an instance's own store, and only while at least one run is in flight on any ticket of that store. Rejected: refusing every unmarked write at all times, as the requester proposed. The operator would then need the marker on every command and would export it in the shell, and every role run started from that shell would inherit it. The operator's decision on the marker assumes unmarked writes when nothing is in flight.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The in-flight rule checks every ticket's in-flight list, not only the calling ticket's. The tool cannot tell which run, if any, is calling.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The marker is the environment variable `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1`. Both workflow scripts put it in front of every clerk command. Rejected: the requester's exemption for "a human's `--by`". Human commands have no `--by`, and `ticket transition` requires one from everyone.
2026-10-04 T-0024 A write is every command except a fixed read-only list: `ticket show`, `ticket join`, `results show`, `config`, `status parse`, `log tail` and `paths`. Any command given `--accept-harness` is a write, because it rewrites the lock and logs. A new command is fenced until someone adds it to the list. Rejected: the requester's list of ten write commands. It misses writes such as `ticket set`, `ticket park`, `ticket head`, `ticket ready-implementers`, `ticket parent-check`, `run compose` and `spec add`.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The refusal exits 2 and writes nothing. Its text is `role runs may not write the live store (<detail>); use a throwaway FACTORY_STATE`. The detail is `<store>; in flight: <run ids>` for the in-flight rule and `<store>; called from inside its runs/` (or `worktrees/`) for the location rule. The advice is meant for a role. The operator learns the marker from README.
2026-10-04 T-0024 A run left in flight by a dead workflow keeps the in-flight rule up. The operator clears it with a marked `run finish <run> --status-override KILLED`, run from the repository root, and README says so. Rejected: a timeout that drops the fence by itself. A long run that is still working would lose the fence.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The fence guards against accidents, not against a determined agent. It is not a security boundary. A role working from outside the store that copies the marker from the workflow scripts or README still gets through. That is recorded under Risk rather than designed around. Isolating role runs at the operating-system level is issue #37.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The fence is checked before the harness lock, the check that each instance runs only the harness revision it has accepted. A fenced command is refused before it reaches the lock, so a fenced `--accept-harness` rewrites nothing. A marked command still meets the lock and its uncommitted-edit refusal unchanged, so the marker cannot be used to get past the lock. Rejected: checking the fence after the lock, because `--accept-harness` rewrites the lock inside that check, so a fenced acceptance would write before it was refused.
2026-10-04 T-0024 Part B (a preamble line) is cut. The incident came from the test suite, not from a command the role typed, so a preamble line would not have stopped it. The refusal text gives the same advice at the moment it matters.
2026-10-04 T-0024 Part C (the tripwire on the store root) is cut. Role runs legitimately write their own run directory in the store (`output.md`, `scratch/`). Clerk commands for other tickets' runs also write the store during a run. A comparison of the store root therefore cannot tell whose write it saw. The fence refuses the write before it happens.
2026-10-04 T-0022 Removing clearly redundant work (a step, run or check that cannot change any outcome) is pre-approved, provided every refusal the pipeline gives today still fires (operator, 2026-10-04: 'slashing clearly redundant work is always going to be OK, if we trust our process')
2026-10-04 T-0022 Under a sub-ticket's Tests to change, the planner may list tests an earlier sibling of the same parent added, with a harness check that each first appeared in a sibling's merge; pre-existing tests still need the approved spec (operator, #40)
2026-10-04 T-0025 The store lives on its own branch, `factory-store`, checked out as a git worktree at the store's path (B1). This is for the operator to confirm at the spec gate. Rejected: B2, the branch written through git plumbing with no working copy. It needs new harness commands to snapshot, show and restore the store, and `git clean -fdx` in the integration checkout deletes the store (Evidence). Rejected: A, a gate exception (operator, 2026-10-04).
2026-10-04 T-0025 A store path must be one the integration branch has never tracked. Both existing stores move from `.factory/state` to `.factory/store`. Rejected: keeping `.factory/state`, where checking out an older commit overwrote an uncommitted record and checking `main` out again deleted it (Evidence).
2026-10-04 T-0025 The branch is named `factory-store`, and the design doc and build spec drop the name `tickets` for it. Rejected: `tickets`, a generic name in a target repo whose branches serve other work, such as the Nanobot repo, which shares its objects with another checkout.
2026-10-04 T-0025 `init` creates a new store as a worktree on an unborn `factory-store` branch, and the operator makes the first commit. On a clone where the branch already exists, `init` checks it out, which restores the store. Rejected: `init` committing, which needs a git identity, and the suite runs under a throwaway HOME that has none.
2026-10-04 T-0025 When no local `factory-store` exists and more than one remote carries it, `init` refuses and names each `<remote>/factory-store`. The operator picks one with `git branch factory-store <remote>/factory-store` and runs `init` again. Rejected: creating a new empty branch, which would silently start a second store history beside the pushed one. Also rejected: preferring `origin`, a guess about which remote is canonical.
2026-10-04 T-0025 With `FACTORY_INSTANCE` unset, `init` refuses, writing nothing, when the caller's git top level is a checkout of `factory-store`. It also refuses when the instance found by walking up from the caller's directory has a store that is that top level, or that contains it in the same repository (the same git common directory). These are the cases where it would build a phantom instance inside the live store. The second condition does not depend on which branch or commit the store has checked out, so a detached store HEAD does not open the route again (operator, round 2 change request N2). The same-repository qualifier keeps `init` working in a separate throwaway repository under a run's scratch directory (Evidence). Rejected: "contains" without that qualifier, which would refuse every suite `init` run with pytest's temporary directory inside a store. Rejected: taking the repository from the parent of `--git-common-dir`. That is the main worktree, which for the Nanobot instance is `~/dev/nanobot`, another checkout on another branch, and for the runtime checkout is `~/dev/spec-factory` (Evidence).
2026-10-04 T-0025 In `init`, every refusal and the store-worktree step come before any instance file is written, so a failed worktree step (for example, git's "already used by worktree" when `init` runs in a code checkout of a repo whose store branch is checked out elsewhere) leaves nothing behind.
2026-10-04 T-0025 The integration checkout ignores the store through the repo's git exclude file, which `init` and `store migrate` write. Rejected: a line in the target's tracked `.gitignore`. That would change the target's code to record a fact about one clone.
2026-10-04 T-0025 A new command, `factory store migrate --to PATH`, moves an existing store. It refuses unless the store is idle and committed, and it leaves the integration-branch side uncommitted for the operator to review. Rejected: a hand procedure, untested, run once on each repo by a different session.
2026-10-04 T-0025 `store migrate` deletes the old store directory only after it has checked that every ignored file (run scratch directories, tripwire baselines) was copied byte for byte. If the check fails, it undoes its own worktree and branch and leaves the old store as it was. Rejected: relying on `git status` in the new checkout, which cannot see ignored files.
2026-10-04 T-0025 The store branch starts with one commit whose tree is the store as last committed on the integration branch, and whose message names that commit. Earlier history stays readable with `git log <that commit> -- .factory/state`. Rejected: rewriting history with a subtree split. It would follow only part of the store's past, which began at `intake/state`, and it adds nothing that `main`'s history does not already keep.
2026-10-04 T-0025 An instance whose store is still a plain directory keeps working unchanged. `init` leaves such a store alone and points to `store migrate`. The harness reads and writes the store only through `state_dir`, so it runs with either layout.
2026-10-04 T-0022 A sub-ticket's "Tests to change" may list a test file that an earlier sibling of the same parent added, one line each: `` `<file>[::<test>]` (added by <sibling ID>): <reason> ``. The harness reads only lines of that form inside the "Tests to change" field, and checks the file, not the test function. Rejected: checking test functions. The implementer rule puts new tests in new files, so a file is what a sibling adds, and git records files.
2026-10-04 T-0022 A listed file counts as added by a sibling when it is absent at the parent's `parent_base`, and the first commit since then on the integration branch that added it lies inside one merged sibling's recorded merge (reachable from its `main_after`, not from its `base_before`). Any merged sibling of the parent counts, including those from an earlier plan. The sibling ID on the line is for the reader and is not matched. Rejected: matching the named ID, because the planner's IDs (`ST-1`) differ from the store's (`T-0001.1`) and the operator's rule names no particular sibling.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The check runs in `run start` for every implementer run of a sub-ticket: first dispatch, fix rounds and catch-up runs. Every dispatch passes through that one place. Rejected: checking when the plan is added, when no sibling has merged yet. Rejected: checking at the merge gate, after the implementer has already edited the test. Rejected: checking where a waiting sub-ticket is released, which happens in two places and never for a sub-ticket with no dependencies.
2026-10-04 T-0022 A failed check refuses the run start with exit 2, writes nothing, and gives an error that starts `BLOCKED from harness:` and names the file. The build workflow parks the sub-ticket with that error as the reason, so `resolve --ruling` handles it like an implementer's BLOCKED. That is what the operator's "parks for the operator, as today" describes. Rejected: a new kind of park with its own resolve verb. Rejected: having `run start` park the ticket itself, which would break the rule that a refusal writes nothing.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The preamble's guardrail sentence and the code reviewer's test-integrity check also accept a sibling entry that the harness has checked. Without them, the implementer and reviewer would still treat the edit as forbidden, and the park would remain.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The earlier sibling names the tests a later sibling will break under a new planner field, "Interim tests". The harness does not read it.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The critic's check for an omitted test goes under rubric 1 (Grounded), where the requester asked for it.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The requester's acceptance, a re-plan and re-spec of Nanobot T-0002 that the operator compares side by side, is an Operator step, not an acceptance scenario. Running it needs the Nanobot store and real agents, which a verifier must not touch.
2026-10-04 T-0032 Empty role output (#41, T-0032): labelled EMPTY-OUTPUT with the last message, re-dispatched once automatically, parked on a second; the code reviewer judges the diff and leaves the test suite and gates to the verifier.
2026-10-04 T-0029 Only the code reviewer lists declared protected paths, once for each head it reviews. The implementer and verifier may name them in their output, but not under ESCALATIONS. This is a standing decision: a later prompt change should not give another role a declared-path notice. The operator pre-approved it on 2026-10-04 (`.factory/answers/operator-decisions-2026-10-04.md`), under the standing decision that removing clearly redundant work is allowed when every refusal still fires.
2026-10-04 T-0029 A fix round makes a new head, so it gets its own reviewer notice, as today. Rejected: one notice per sub-ticket. A fix round can change a declared path again, and the operator would not hear about it.
2026-10-04 T-0029 The new rule also keeps one escalation for a declared path: when the change does something to it that the spec does not describe. An undeclared path still escalates as well. Rejected: the retro's wording "the reviewer lists declared paths for the merge gate". No local merge check reads the declaration, so that sentence would teach the roles something false.
2026-10-04 T-0029 The implementer and verifier get the same bullet word for word, as the last bullet under RULES. That way one text is checked in both prompts.
2026-10-04 T-0029 The changelog records the count re-derived from the store log (10 runs, 30 of 205 items). Rejected: the retro's 26 of 139, which its own table contradicts with 38.
2026-10-04 T-0029 Acceptance checks the composed run prompts and the document copies. The request's own check (on the next build, one notice per head, from the reviewer) is kept as an operator step. Rejected: an acceptance item that waits for a real build. The verifier cannot run one, and how a model follows a prompt rule is not something a check on one commit can prove.
2026-10-05 T-0028 Part A overturns the cut in T-0016's spec. The path-scoped gate skip is built as the operator pre-approved it, with no repository's configuration changed. Rejected: cutting it again because it would have skipped almost no past run. The request expects a small saving here and still asks for the mechanism. Part A is a separate part, so the operator can delete it and its scenarios at the gate.
2026-10-05 T-0028 A gate command's `paths` are git pathspecs. A command is skipped when `git diff --name-only <base>...<head> -- <paths>` lists no file. Include entries (`src/`) and exclude entries (`:(exclude)dev/`) both work. Rejected: a glob matcher of our own, a second matching rule that could disagree with git's. Standing: later tickets and instance configs use pathspec semantics.
2026-10-05 T-0028 If this repository's suite is ever scoped, its paths should exclude what it does not read rather than list what it does: `:(exclude)dev/` and `:(exclude)README.md`. Rejected: the requester's inclusion list, which leaves out `.gitignore` and any new top-level file, so it would skip the suite on changes that fail it.
2026-10-05 T-0028 The harness decides the skip when a reviewer or verifier run starts on a sub-ticket. It reads the live instance's configuration and that run's base and head. The verifier is told which commands are skipped, so it does not decide. Rejected: letting the verifier judge relevance, which no record could check.
2026-10-05 T-0028 Each skipped command is recorded twice: in the checker run's `meta.yaml` (`gate_skipped`) and on the `ci` row (`skipped`). Each entry has the command, `status: SKIPPED` and the reason. The row's PASS or FAIL still comes from the verifier's `Gate suite:` line, over the commands that ran.
2026-10-05 T-0028 A malformed gate entry refuses every implementer, reviewer and verifier run start with exit 2, before a run is created. A malformed entry is anything other than a string, or a mapping with a non-empty string `command` and an optional non-empty list of non-empty strings `paths`, with no other key. Rejected: treating a typo such as `path:` as unscoped. The operator would believe a scope is in force that is not.
2026-10-05 T-0028 An empty `paths` list is refused. Rejected: reading it as "covers nothing", which would skip the command on every diff.
2026-10-05 T-0028 The planner is skipped when all of these hold, and otherwise runs as today: the parent has no sub-ticket and no earlier planner run; its latest spec-writer run did not end NEEDS-SPLIT; and its approved spec has no `##` or `###` heading, other than a `### Requirement:` line, that contains the word seam or seams. This sorts all thirteen past parents as they were built (Evidence). Rejected: the requester's "exactly one lettered part", which would have skipped none of the nine. Rejected: NEEDS-SPLIT alone, which would have built T-0025's two parts, about 470 lines, as one sub-ticket. Standing: the planner runs only for a spec that is split, re-planned or already planned once.
2026-10-05 T-0028 To force the planner on a spec that meets every condition, the operator adds a `### Size and seams` heading in a gate edit (`approve-spec --edit`). No new flag.
2026-10-05 T-0028 The whole-spec sub-ticket is `<parent>.1`, at `ready-for-implementer`, with no dependency. Its text names every scenario of the approved spec, one `- <name>` line each. For everything else it points to the spec: every lettered part, the spec's labels, its Tests to change and its Risk list. Because it names every scenario, the parent closes on its VERIFIED run under the existing rule (part C).
2026-10-05 T-0028 The store records the skip three ways: a `plan.skipped` event in the log with its reason, the parent's plan file (`plans/<parent>.md`), and the change folder's `tasks.md` when the repository has a spec store. A planner-made plan writes the same two files.
2026-10-05 T-0028 A spec already applied on `main`, the planner's most frequent ESCALATE, is caught after the skip by the implementer's step 2 and by the verifier's base run of NEW checks (design part B, table). The catch costs an implementer run in place of a planner run. Rejected: a harness check of "already applied", which would need the agents' judgment of what the spec asks for.
2026-10-07 T-0032 Retry-once-then-park on a role's unusable output (#41's EMPTY-OUTPUT) is the general mechanism: later refusal kinds (#68 format, #67 spec-lint) register with it rather than adding their own. resolve --ruling should also accept a budget-kill or EMPTY-OUTPUT park (rulings had to be placed by hand on T-0029.1 and T-0028.1).
2026-10-07 T-0032 An empty output is `EMPTY-OUTPUT`, never a budget kill. That covers a missing or empty output file, an agent call that returns blank text, and one that returns `null` (a user skip or a terminal API error). Rejected: keeping a budget-kill path for some of these. The harness enforces no budget, and the agent call reports no reason (Evidence).
2026-10-07 T-0032 Standing, from the operator's answer, already in `decisions.md` as the 2026-10-04 T-0032 line, for both parts: the empty-output route, and the reviewer leaving the suite and the gate to the verifier. Later changes follow both.
2026-10-07 T-0032 `EMPTY-OUTPUT` is decided in one place, `run finish`. The workflows no longer send `--status-override KILLED` for an empty return, so `run finish` reads the output file for every run. Rejected: a second override value in the scripts. It would label a run empty even when its output file was written.
2026-10-07 T-0032 The retry is counted inside one workflow run: one re-dispatch, then a park. Rejected: a counter in the store. It would add a ticket field for a case that a human already watches, because a workflow that stops is restarted by hand.
2026-10-07 T-0032 A thrown agent call is not re-dispatched. It carries its own error text, including the error thrown when the turn's token ceiling is spent, so it is the one stop the harness can name.
2026-10-07 T-0032 The last message is kept by a new command, `factory run last-message RUN --text=…`, called only after `run finish` has returned `EMPTY-OUTPUT`. The text is the last 4000 characters, as one shell single-quoted word. Rejected: passing it on every `run finish`, which would put each role's whole output through every clerk command.
2026-10-07 T-0032 A second empty output parks as `EMPTY-OUTPUT from <role>`, in the same form as the other role parks, and lists both runs. The last messages stay in the run directories, not in the reason.
2026-10-07 T-0032 A checker's second empty output parks before any result row is recorded for it. `resolve --redispatch` then re-runs only that checker, because the other checker's passing rows stand. Rejected: an `EMPTY-OUTPUT` result row and a join rule for it, a new row status for the same outcome.
2026-10-07 T-0032 The reviewer's input no longer lists the gate commands. It says that the verifier runs them, as the design's routing table already declares (`docs/design.md:126`).
2026-10-07 T-0032 The `budget kill` join reason is kept for hand-recorded `KILLED` rows. Rejected: renaming it, which would change three existing tests for a case no one reported.
2026-10-07 T-0032 `build.js:137` (the implementer's `budget kill` park) is removed. `run finish` can no longer return `KILLED` to the workflow, so the line would never run.
2026-10-07 T-0033 Protected paths at merge (#57, T-0033): the pinned spec's Risk list is the authorization; an undeclared changed protected path is refused at merge and parks for a ruling; no per-head approval step. All instances.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The critic keeps its minimum check, at least 2 cited paths and 1 acceptance command per review. It gains a cap of at most 2 paths and 1 command for any one claim. Rejected: replacing the minimum with the cap, which would let a critic approve having checked nothing. `docs/principles.md`'s Spiking section states the bound per claim ("Grounding a claim … two paths, one command").
2026-10-08 T-0034 The critic runs no test suite and builds nothing (no clone, worktree or prototype of the change). It runs an acceptance command only as the spec gives it, and picks one that runs no test suite. Standing: a later change to the critic prompt keeps this rule, as principle 2 requires.
2026-10-08 T-0034 A claim the critic could settle only by running a test suite or building the change is a finding for the writer, or a question, and the critic says what it could not check. The finding's severity follows the existing rubric. Rubric item 2 ("NEW items fail today") stays unchanged.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The writer and the critic get the same three reading sentences: batch independent reads and commands, read a line range once grep has found it, and send long output to a scratch file and grep or tail it. Only the writer gets "write the spec in as few writes as you can". The critic writes one verdict and needs no such rule.
2026-10-08 T-0034 No shared preamble line. The rules go only in the two role prompts. Rejected: a preamble line, which would reach every role, including the implementer and verifier, which the request does not cover.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The rules are added as new lines only, so no existing line of either prompt changes. The writer's rule is the last RULES bullet of the documented copy. The critic's rules follow its existing PROCESS line.
2026-10-08 T-0034 `docs/principles.md` records the critic's new rule under principle 2 and corrects principle 2's status line, which says "reader roles run no suites" was done by #41 alone.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The request's acceptance, a replay of 2–3 approved intakes with old and new prompts, is an Operator step. Running it needs live model runs, and judging spec quality side by side is a human call. The scenarios check the text the roles receive.
2026-10-08 T-0035 This change overturns part of a standing decision, one that later tickets must keep, recorded on 2026-10-08 for T-0034, the ticket that applied #73: "The critic runs no test suite and builds nothing ... Standing: a later change to the critic prompt keeps this rule". The no-test-suite half stands. The no-build half and the per-claim cap (T-0034's other 2026-10-08 decision) are removed. Authority: the operator's choice in `.factory/answers/T-0034-acceptance-2026-10-08.md`. Standing: later changes to the critic prompt keep the no-suite rule and do not re-add a per-claim cap or a no-build rule without new evidence.
2026-10-08 T-0035 The critic prompt gains one sentence that allows a small experiment in its scratch directory to confirm a finding. Without it, the kept sentence "A claim you could settle only by ... building the change is a finding" reads as the old ban. The kept sentence still covers building or trying out the change itself, which the request's item C (its `docs/principles.md` change) leaves to the writer or to a spike, a ticket built only to test whether an approach works. Rejected: deleting the kept sentence. The triage role, which sorts a request before the spec writer sees it, asked to keep it, and it still tells the critic what to do with a claim it cannot check.
2026-10-08 T-0035 The no-suite line gains its reason, "the implementer and the verifier run it", as the request's item B (its list of what the critic keeps) gives. `Pick an acceptance command that runs no test suite, and run it as the spec gives it.` and the Turn economy paragraph stay word for word.
2026-10-08 T-0035 The Spiking section records the replay result, as the request's item C asks ("Record the replay result"). The changelog entry records it too.
2026-10-08 T-0035 Of the current-truth requirements that #73 added, four are restated (MODIFIED), because each states the rule being removed or forbids removing a critic line. Other current-truth requirements that check the diff of their own change (for example "The documents record the live-store guard", which expects no prompt copy to change) are left as they are, as #73 left them. Their scenarios describe their own change, not standing behaviour.
2026-10-08 T-0035 "Writer unchanged from #73" is checked as no difference from `05cf8f9` in either writer prompt file, plus the writer's design block equal to its `docs/prompts/` copy. Together these mean the design block is unchanged too.
2026-10-09 T-0036 Triage names the capabilities on a new output line, `Capabilities:`, chosen from a capability index added to its input. A token that names no current-truth capability, such as `none` or `new`, is ignored.
2026-10-09 T-0036 Which capabilities a role receives in full: the names on triage's line, plus each existing capability whose `specs/<name>/spec.md` path appears in the spec the role works from. For the writer that is its previous version on a revision round. For the critic it is the version under review. For the planner it is the approved version, read whole, Evidence included. A writer that opens a capability and cites its path under Evidence therefore hands it to the critic. This keeps the request's rule that the critic sees the writer's list plus whatever the writer opened.
2026-10-09 T-0036 A ticket whose latest finished triage output has no `Capabilities:` line gets today's inputs, the whole of current truth and the whole log. This covers tickets triaged before this change, T-0036 among them. Rejected: sending only the index in that case, which would cut those tickets' inputs with no list to cut by.
2026-10-09 T-0036 An index line for a capability gives its name, its size, the absolute path of its spec and its requirement names. Rejected: the request's "one-sentence purpose", because no capability spec on either store has a purpose paragraph (Evidence).
2026-10-09 T-0036 A decision line goes in full when it is logged against this ticket, or when its text names a capability sent in full as a whole word. The log's other lines are indexed one line per ticket: ticket id, number of decisions, first and last date, and the ticket's title. The index heading gives the command `grep ' <ticket id> ' <absolute path of decisions.md>`. Rejected: one index line per decision, which comes to tens of kilobytes on Nanobot (240 lines, median 278 bytes).
2026-10-09 T-0036 A role opens deferred items by path, with its own file reads or `grep`. No `factory spec show` or `factory decision show` command is added. Rejected: those commands, because a command run from inside a role must clear the live-store fence and find the instance from the role's working directory. A path needs neither, and it is how compose already points at full specs (Evidence).
2026-10-09 T-0036 The instructions live in the index headings. They say the list is complete, that anything in it is opened by its path, and that citing a path hands the capability to the critic. Rejected: editing the writer and critic prompts, which would put the same words in two more protected copies.
2026-10-09 T-0036 A run's `input_sources` lists only the files sent in full. An index adds no source.
2026-10-09 T-0036 The standing 2026-10-04 T-0024 decision says that `decisions.md` "keeps reaching the spec writer, critic and planner". It still does: in full for the lines this ticket touches, and line by line for the rest through the index and its `grep` command.
2026-10-09 T-0036 Acceptance does not hold this change to the request's 40 kB mean and 100 kB maximum. The projection gives a mean of 101 kB and a maximum of 167 kB for the Nanobot store's last ten tickets, and the remainder lies outside this change (Problem, Evidence). The operator steps measure the real figures after the change runs.
2026-10-09 T-0036 The docs use one name for the new index, "capability index".
2026-10-09 T-0037 Decision log in role inputs (#78, T-0037): the spec writer, critic and planner get decisions.md whole; #75's decision filter is removed; any future scoping must not be able to drop a cross-cutting standing decision (see #54).

## Your prior findings (round 1)

Spec critic, T-0037 v1 (issue #78: the spec writer, critic and planner get `decisions.md` whole again).

What I checked, on `main` (`51e2af7`), with a throwaway HOME:
- `factory/compose.py:138-142` is `CAPABILITY_INDEX_NOTE` with the clause ", and the decisions that name it to the critic and the planner,"; `:226-255` is `add_decisions`, whose whole-log branch at `:232-234` runs only when `selected()` (`:205-213`) returns `None`, that is when triage wrote no `Capabilities:` line; filtering `:235-243`, trimmed heading `:244-246`, index with `grep` `:247-255`; callers at `:273`, `:292`, `:315`. All as the spec cites.
- `tests/factory/test_capability_index.py`: docstring `:1-9`, `CITES` at `:22` used only at `:125`, helpers `:194-203`, the four decision tests `:206-238`. These are the only tests in `tests/factory/`, `factory/`, `docs/prompts/` and `agents/` that pin the trimmed heading, the index or the note clause (grep for `Decision index`, `decision_index`, `naming a capability given in full`, `decisions that name it`). `test_a_whitespace_only_log_still_adds_nothing` (`:241`) and the part-B4 tests (`:248` on) assert the whole-log heading and no index, so they pass after the change. `tests/factory/test_decision_log.py:205-215` expects the whole-log heading. "Tests to change" is complete and names only tests the change breaks.
- Docs: `docs/design.md:94` holds the two sentences C.1 replaces and is the file's only `decision index` match; `README.md:85-87` are the three rows and the only three matches; `README.md:9` is the Status line, `:963` "Maintaining this page"; `docs/changelog.md:64` is entry 60, no entry 61 exists. `dev/build-harness.spec.md:193` does say `run compose` gives a non-empty `decisions.md` to the writer, critic and planner, with no filter. No `docs/prompts/` file mentions the index.
- Ran the harness-docs scenario as given: `design-index=1 design-whole=0 readme-index=3 readme-whole=0 changelog=0`, then `whitespace=ok`. Matches Evidence and the NEW claim.
- Ran the NEW role-inputs scenario through the `t0036-store.sh` fixture from current truth: the three lines match the Evidence block byte for byte (`other=0 whole=0 index=1 grep-cmd=1`, `note-decisions=1` for W and C, `0` for P). It fails today for the stated reason, and a stub that only drops the index without adding the whole log would still fail (`whole=0`, `other=0`).
- The standing decision exists: `.factory/store/decisions.md` last line is the 2026-10-09 T-0037 line the spec quotes. The spec's Decision 1 restates it; no hidden product choice.
- Sizes: this repo's log is 109 lines, 35,991 B, as the table says. The Nanobot log is 266 lines, 79,997 B today (read-only `wc`), not 254 / 76,342 B.
- Not checked: the suite scenario and the post-change outputs of the two role-inputs scenarios, which need the build; the implementer and verifier run those. Scenario 2's REGRESSION claim rests on `add_truth` and the note's remaining text, which A.3 and A.4 keep, so I expect it to hold.

Findings

[BLOCKING] 6 Operator steps, first bullet
Problem: "move the runtime once" and "`factory --accept-harness <sha> <command>`" are terms specific to this system that no human-facing section glosses, so an operator new to the system cannot tell from the spec why merging the PR does not by itself change what the roles receive, or what "moving the runtime" is.
Evidence: Problem, Evidence, Decisions and Operator steps never say what the runtime is; the only hint is the Out of scope line "The runtime move itself". `docs/writing.md:32` requires a gloss at first use.
Suggested fix: open the bullet with a clause such as "The factory runs from a separate runtime checkout that a merge into `main` does not change; after merge, move that runtime once ... and adopt the new revision in each target with `factory --accept-harness <sha> <command>` (README, 'Upgrade')".

[NIT] 1 Evidence, size table, Nanobot row; design.md C.3 (changelog figures)
Problem: the Nanobot log is 266 lines and 79,997 B today, so the table's 254 / 76,342 B and the changelog's "76.4 kB" are already stale; the store is live and will drift further.
Evidence: `wc -lc ~/dev/nanobot-upstream/.factory/store/decisions.md` → `266 79997`.
Suggested fix: date the measurement in the table caption ("measured 2026-10-09") and round the changelog figures to "about 36 kB here and about 80 kB on Nanobot", or state them as of that date.

[NIT] 6 Problem, first paragraph
Problem: "the store" is used inside the gloss of capability ("the store's record of how one part of the system behaves today") without being glossed itself.
Evidence: no earlier sentence says what the store is.
Suggested fix: "the store, the factory's per-repo record of specs, tickets and decisions".

No finding on scope: one PR, the out-of-scope list is sensible, every protected path touched (`factory/compose.py`) is declared under Risk, and Decision 2's one-clause edit to #75's note is called out rather than made silently. No conflict with the role-inputs current truth that stays (the no-`Capabilities:` requirement remains true) or with #54, which the T-0037 decision line already constrains.

STATUS: REVISE
CONFIDENCE: high, the one blocking item is a missing gloss with a one-clause fix; every cited path, line range, test and today's output of both NEW scenarios checked out.
ESCALATIONS: none

 ## Problem
-Since issue #75, three agent roles can miss a standing rule that every ticket must follow. Those roles are the spec writer, which writes a ticket's spec; the critic, which reviews it; and the planner, which splits an approved spec into pieces of work. The rules sit in the decision log, `decisions.md`, one line per standing decision with its date and the ticket that made it. #75 cut each of those roles' input to save context: a decision line now reaches them in full only when it was logged against their own ticket, or when its text names a capability they receive in full. A capability is one current-truth spec, the store's record of how one part of the system behaves today. Every other line is reduced to one entry per ticket in a "decision index", with a `grep` command the role may run to read it.
+Since issue #75, a recent change that trimmed each agent's input to save context, three agent roles can miss a standing rule that every ticket must follow.

-No decision line in either store names a capability, so the filter hides every rule that some other ticket made. In the operator's replay of a Nanobot ticket, the spec writer put new code in a module that a standing decision rules out, and the critic did not notice. Both had seen that decision only as an index line. The operator has chosen to send the whole decision log to these three roles again and to keep the rest of #75, the capability filter. The cost is about 34 kB more input per run on this repo's store and about 72 kB more on the Nanobot store.

 - Replay of #75 on Nanobot ticket T-0032, 2026-10-09 (the request): the new writer put its code in `nanobot/cron/session_sweep.py`. Standing decision T-0003 rules that out: lionbot code goes through upstream's extension points first. The original writer, given the whole log, followed T-0003, and the original critic confirmed it. The replay critic missed the conflict.

-  The rise is about 33.5 kB per input on spec-factory and 71.5 kB on Nanobot. That agrees with the operator's estimates of writer input after the change: about 135 kB on spec-factory and about 235 kB on Nanobot.

 ## Root cause
 `add_decisions` in `factory/compose.py:226-255` keeps a decision line only when it is logged against the ticket or names a selected capability, as a whole word. A cross-cutting standing decision names no capability, so for any ticket with a `Capabilities:` line it is reduced to an index entry. The writer, critic and planner then follow only the rules they choose to open.

 ## Risk
-Blast radius: the input of every spec writer, critic and planner run on every target that adopts this harness revision. Each grows by the size of its log, about 34 kB here and 72 kB on Nanobot per run (Evidence). Triage, implementer, reviewer and verifier inputs do not change. A mistake here would drop decisions from those inputs or break the capability half. The NEW scenario and the two REGRESSION scenarios cover both.

 ## Operator steps
-- After merge, move the runtime once so that #75 and this fix ship together, and adopt it in each target with `factory --accept-harness <sha> <command>` (README, "Upgrade").
-- On the first spec writer run in each store after that move, check that its `input.md` holds `## Decision log (decisions.md): standing decisions, read-only` and no `## Decision index`.
+- Merging this change does not by itself change what the roles receive. Tickets run from the runtime, a separate checkout of the harness pinned to one commit (`~/dev/spec-factory-harness`), and a merge into `main` never moves it. #75 is merged but held from the runtime until this fix merges. After merge, move the runtime once to the merge commit, so that #75 and this fix ship together (README, "Upgrading the runtime", step 1).
+- Each target repository runs only the harness commit recorded in its `harness.lock`, and refuses its store after a runtime move until it accepts the new commit. In each target that should adopt this change, run any store command once with `--accept-harness <sha>`, where `<sha>` is the runtime's new commit (README, "Upgrading the runtime", step 2).
+- On the first spec writer run in each target after that, check that its `input.md` holds `## Decision log (decisions.md): standing decisions, read-only` and no `## Decision index`.

+## Responses
+- [BLOCKING] Operator steps, runtime and `--accept-harness` not glossed → FIXED. The first Operator step now says what the runtime is (a separate checkout of the harness pinned to one commit, which a merge into `main` never moves) and why merging alone changes nothing. A new second step says what `harness.lock` and `--accept-harness <sha>` do. Both cite README "Upgrading the runtime" (`README.md:539-545`), whose steps they follow.
+- [NIT] Nanobot size figures stale → FIXED. Re-measured on 2026-10-09 with the same mirror script: Nanobot is 266 lines and 79,997 B, before 4,875 B (27 tickets indexed, 0 lines kept), after 80,061 B; spec-factory unchanged at 109 lines, 2,581 B before and 36,055 B after. The table caption is dated and notes the Nanobot log is live. The Problem and Risk figures moved from 72 kB to 75 kB. Changelog part C.3 now gives rounded figures as of that date: under 3 kB to about 36 kB here, about 5 kB to about 80 kB on Nanobot.
+- [NIT] "the store" unglossed in Problem → FIXED. The capability gloss now ends "where the store is the factory's per-repository record of tickets, specs and decisions". I also introduced issue #75 at first use as "a recent change that trimmed each agent's input to save context" (writing standard rule 6).
+- Not a finding, but strengthened: the suite REGRESSION claim now rests on a full run, not a subset. On `main` with a throwaway HOME and the default TMPDIR, the suite scenario's command printed `suite=0` (384 passed); Evidence and Acceptance say so.
