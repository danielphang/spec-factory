## Context for this run (composed by the harness, not part of the request)

Repository: `spec-factory`, the design repo at `~/dev/spec-factory` (branch `main`). It holds the
design and the harness that runs it:
- `docs/design.md`, the design document and the source of truth, with its changelog in
  `docs/changelog.md`;
- `docs/prompts/`, each file a verbatim copy of one prompt block in the design doc; it changes only
  by re-copying that block;
- `dev/`: `dev/issues.md`, this repo's issue index, kept live; and the build spec, its plan and the
  P0 walking skeleton, frozen as history from building the harness, which no change updates;
- the harness, as code in this repo: `factory/` (the package, its role prompts and its workflow
  scripts), `bin/factory` (the entry point), `agents/` (the agent definition templates) and
  `tests/factory/` (its suite). Install with `uv sync --frozen`; test with
  `uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory`;
- `.factory/`, this repo's own instance of the factory: `instance.yaml`, this briefing,
  `harness.lock`, closed records (`answers/`, `green-pilot/`) and the live store, `store/`.
  The store is a checkout of its own branch, `factory-store`; the operator commits it there, so a
  store commit never moves `main`.

Two checkouts. Tickets are built and merged in the dev checkout, `~/dev/spec-factory` on `main`.
The factory runs from the runtime checkout, `~/dev/spec-factory-harness`, a detached worktree of
this repo at the harness revision `.factory/harness.lock` has accepted. A merge into `main` never
changes the running code; only the upgrade step moves the runtime, after which the instance
refuses its store until `--accept-harness`. Your shell may start in another directory: use
absolute paths, or `cd ~/dev/spec-factory && <cmd>`.

The Nanobot fork at `~/dev/nanobot-upstream` (branch `feat/lionbot-v3.5`) is instance A: a target
with only `.factory/`, run from the same runtime by its own Driver session. This repo's harness was
imported from its retired `feat/lionbot-v3` branch. Read it only to observe what a fix does there; never write there, and never copy its test names,
line numbers or commit SHAs into a spec. Never read or write `~/.nanobot/` (live credentials).

Acceptance commands must be runnable as written from `~/dev/spec-factory` (grep, sed, diff,
`git diff --check` against the documents, the harness suite). A change to the design doc keeps its
own conventions: its changelog entry in `docs/changelog.md`, and any `docs/prompts/` file whose
block changed re-copied from it.

The request is an issue draft, written from a real pipeline run: where in the documents,
what happened (the evidence), why it matters, a proposed fix, and the Nanobot-side commit
where a harness fix already exists. The evidence is the requirement; the proposed fix is the
requester's suggestion, not a requirement. Verify the as-built fix in the reference harness
before relying on it; a NEW criterion that already passes on this checkout proves nothing.

Output: write your complete output, in your role's required format and ending with the
STATUS / CONFIDENCE / ESCALATIONS trailer, to the file named under "Output file" below. For
every role but the implementer that is the only file you may create or modify. The implementer
also changes files in its own worktree and commits there, and nowhere else. Then return the same
text as your final message.

This repo's current-state page is the top-level `README.md`. A change to a command, state, stop or
path updates it in the same ticket; read its "Maintaining this page" section before editing it.

Who reads what the roles write here: the operator at the spec gate, and a technical reader new to this project reading the README or a PR description. Gloss every term specific to the factory at first use (docs/writing.md).
## Output file
`/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/runs/run-0589-critic/output.md`

## Running code
Run every test, script or prototype through this wrapper, which gives it a fresh temporary HOME so it cannot write the operator's real home directory: `([ -z "${VIRTUAL_ENV:-}" ] || PATH=$(printf %s "$PATH" | tr : '\n' | grep -vxF "$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin" | paste -sd: -); unset VIRTUAL_ENV PYTHONHOME; export HOME="$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P)"; <command>)`. Put your command in place of <command>. This includes every test or check command the briefing above gives. A throwaway HOME does not stop a write to an absolute path: never run anything that could write a protected path outside the repository.

## Scratch directory
Put every file you make for your own use in this run under `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/runs/run-0589-critic/scratch`: no other run uses it. The harness clears it when the ticket moves on, and keeps it while the ticket is parked.

## Spec under review (v2)

=== proposal.md
## Problem

The factory keeps a written record of what the system it builds must do, called current truth. Current truth is a set of capability specs, one per area of behaviour, in the store (the factory's record of tickets, runs and specs). Each spec holds scenarios. A scenario is a shell command, its WHEN, and the output the command must print, its THEN. A ticket's verifier, the agent that checks a change against its spec, runs that spec's scenarios once, while the ticket is built. When the ticket closes, its scenarios join current truth, and nothing runs them again.

So a change can break a scenario that an earlier ticket wrote, and still merge. The merge gate, the commands every change must pass before it merges, runs only a whitespace check and the test suite. The verifier runs only its own spec's scenarios. The breakage stays hidden until someone happens to run the old scenario by hand. It has happened here: five scenarios no longer pass on `main`. A later change made the harness refuse a role model the instance does not name, and these scenarios' setup scripts still pass a different one. It has happened on the Nanobot target too.

The operator, who approves specs and merges and relies on current truth being true, asked for two things. One is a command, `factory truth check`, that replays every scenario against a checkout and reports each result. The other is for this repo's merge gate to run that command, so that a change that breaks any scenario cannot merge.

The command has two practical limits. First, current truth always lags the code a little: a ticket's scenarios join it only when the ticket closes, which can be days after its first sub-ticket merged. The check must not report those tickets' intended changes as regressions. Second, cost: replaying all 316 scenarios takes several minutes, and an agent's single shell command is cut off at ten minutes. The operator has decided that the gate's replay leaves out the three scenarios that themselves run the whole test suite, because the same gate runs that suite anyway. That keeps the replay to about two minutes on top of the suite.

## Evidence

Figures were measured in scratch clones of `main`: today's at `11080b1`, its current tip, and earlier ones, marked as such, at `3e4705a` and `b863e4e`. The prototype runner, which reads current truth and runs each WHEN under bash as design part A describes, is this run's scratch `proto.py`. Its listings are `run-gate2.txt` (current truth as it is) and `run-fixed.txt` (with the two setup lines below fixed). The shell was the `bash` on `PATH`, Homebrew bash 5.3.9; nothing was measured under macOS's `/bin/bash` 3.2.

- **Nothing replays current truth.** The gate is `git diff --check main...HEAD` and the harness suite (`.factory/instance.yaml`, `gate_commands`). The verifier's input lists only its own spec and the gate commands (`factory/compose.py:354`).
- **Size.** Current truth holds 316 scenarios in 15 capabilities (`grep -c '^#### Scenario'` on each `spec.md`).
- **Readable by a strict rule.** Every scenario has exactly one WHEN line, and every WHEN line ends with the command's closing backtick. The rule this spec defines (design part A) reads 288 of the 316 THENs as exact prints. The other 28 are prose, such as "reports a number of passed tests" or "two numbers: the first below 900", or an exact print followed by sentences that explain it.
- **Scenarios that run the suite.** 13 WHENs run the whole harness suite. Ten of their THENs are prose and are skipped whatever the gate does. Three are exact prints: role-inputs' "The harness suite passes with the new inputs" and "The harness suite passes with the whole decision log", and store-setup's "The suite fails on a template with broken frontmatter and names it".
- **Result on `main` at `11080b1`,** run as the gate would run it, skipping WHENs that contain the suite command: 281 passed, 4 failed, 31 skipped (13 for running the suite, 18 for a prose THEN), in 121 s. No two scenarios share a name. On today's 316, each of the 118 lines that names another scenario's GIVEN block names a scenario that exists.
- **The 4 failures are one escaped defect.** The harness-code one's stderr is `model m refused for triage: the instance names opus`. The other three discard their run start's stderr; run by hand, that start prints `model opus refused for reviewer: the instance names fable`. T-0050 (`b3b978d`) made `run start` refuse a `--model` that differs from the instance's (`factory/cli.py:183-185`). Two setup lines still pass one. One is the shared fixture of role-escalations' "Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule", which passes `--model opus` for every role, so every reviewer prompt it asks for is refused. Three scenarios that ask for one fail: role-escalations' other two, and harness-docs' "Implementer, reviewer and verifier run prompts carry the wait rule, and only the reviewer's carries the judge-the-diff rule". The other is harness-code's "Spec pinning and planner-run refusals keep their text", which passes `--model m`. A fifth scenario, harness-docs' "Implementer, reviewer and verifier runs receive the reading paragraph", reuses the same fixture and fails the same way, but its THEN is prose, so the rule skips it.
- **The fix works.** With `--model` dropped from those two lines, all 15 capabilities ran 285 passed, 0 failed, 31 skipped, in 124 s (`11080b1`, skipping as the gate does).
- **Merged but not yet archived.** T-0056.1 merged at `b863e4e` while T-0056 was still open. README went to 1,189 lines while current truth still said "at most 1,185". On that commit, harness-docs, harness-code, factory-stats and build-dispatch showed 6 failures against plain current truth. Four of them were scenarios of requirements that T-0056's approved delta restates. Folding T-0056's delta and skipping its own scenarios left only the 2 model failures.
- **Comparison rule.** All 285 passes compared stdout exactly, spaces included, once one trailing newline was removed. None needed other whitespace trimmed, and none whose THEN says "it prints `X`" without "exactly" needed a looser match.
- **Isolation** (at `3e4705a`, 306 scenarios). One capability's scenarios, run in order with their own TMPDIR, gave the same 273/4/29 whether the 15 capabilities ran one after another or all at once.
- **Wall time (requirement E).** The suite alone takes 119 s (the request) and took 118 s here.

  | How the 15 capabilities ran | Commit, scenarios | Wall time | Passed / failed / skipped |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | one after another | `3e4705a`, 306 | 687 s | 273 / 4 / 29 |
  | all at once | `3e4705a`, 306 | 482 s | 273 / 4 / 29 |
  | all at once, skipping WHENs that run the suite | `3e4705a`, 306 | 157 s | 270 / 4 / 32 |
  | all at once, skipping WHENs that run the suite | `11080b1`, 316 | 121 s | 281 / 4 / 31 |
  | the same, with the two setup lines fixed | `11080b1`, 316 | 124 s | 285 / 0 / 31 |

  The `3e4705a` rows came from an earlier prototype whose rule lacked the "N lines:" form; T-0056's scenarios, which use it, were not yet in current truth. At `3e4705a`, run all at once, the three suite-running scenarios with exact THENs took 285 s, 177 s and 412 s. Run alone, each takes about one suite run. So a gate run now costs the suite plus about two minutes.
- **The ten-minute limit.** A role runs its gate commands through Claude Code's Bash tool, which stops a foreground command after at most 600,000 ms. No `BASH_MAX_TIMEOUT_MS` is set in this environment, and `factory drive` passes role processes the driver's own environment (`factory/drive.py:214`). One serial replay (687 s) does not fit. `factory drive --parallel 2` can run two verifiers at once.
- **Where a checker runs.** A checker's checkout is `<store>/runs/<run>/wt`, a detached checkout of the head it checks; the implementer's is `<store>/worktrees/<id>` (`factory/cli.py:237`, `:252`). Each run's `meta.yaml` names its `ticket`; the parent-close verifier's names the parent. From either checkout, the walk-up finds the checkout's own `.factory/instance.yaml`, whose store path does not exist there. So the check needs the store named explicitly.
- **Size limits this change meets.** `factory/cli.py` is at 899 lines, and current truth requires it to stay "under 900" (harness-code, "The command-line code has one module per job"). T-0057, approved and not yet built, also adds lines to `cli.py`. README is at 1,212 lines against current truth's 1,225, and T-0057 adds one line.
- **Lists this change extends.** Current truth names every command the live-store fence (the guard against writes to the store during a run) leaves open, and every command that skips the harness lock (the check that an instance runs only the harness revision it accepted). Both are in `openspec/specs/live-store-guard/spec.md`. Changing either list changes those requirements.
- **Capabilities opened.** `openspec/specs/role-escalations/spec.md`, `openspec/specs/harness-code/spec.md`, `openspec/specs/live-store-guard/spec.md`, `openspec/specs/gate-commands/spec.md`, `openspec/specs/harness-docs/spec.md`, and every other capability's spec as the prototype's input.

## Root cause

No component replays current truth. `factory/specstore.py` parses deltas and folds them into current truth only at archive (`apply_delta`, `factory/specstore.py:385`; `archive`, `:398`). `gate_commands` in `.factory/instance.yaml` holds no replay, and the verifier's prompt has no rule for comparing a print, so each verifier judged THENs by eye.

## Out of scope

- Rewriting prose THENs as exact prints, and fixing scenarios that only describe their own change's diff.
- Adopting the check on another target, which is that target's owner's decision (requirement D).
- Reusing the check in `factory fast-track` (#87).
- A per-scenario time limit, a `--jobs` setting and a `--ticket` option: the gate needs none of them.
- Reading a scenario's preconditions, such as "with `node` on `PATH`": a missing tool makes its scenario fail.
- Any change to `factory/specstore.py`, `factory/compose.py`, a role prompt or `docs/prompts/`.

## Open questions

none. The previous version's question, whether the gate's replay skips the three scenarios that run the whole harness suite, is answered under Decisions.

## Decisions

- The exact-print rule. A THEN of the form "it prints [exactly|only] <lines>" lists its expected lines in backticks, joined by ", then", ", and", ", " or " and". The list may open with "[these] N lines:", or read "N lines, each `X`"; it may be followed by ", one per line", ", twice", ", three times", a parenthetical note without backticks, or " and exits 0". A THEN ending "these N lines:" takes them from the fenced block after it. The WHEN's stdout, less one trailing newline, must equal those lines exactly. Measured at `11080b1`: 288 of 316 THENs read, and every one that ran and passed compared exactly.
- "it prints `X`" reads the same as "it prints exactly `X`". Stderr is never compared. The exit status is compared only when the THEN says "and exits 0". Rejected: a contains match, which no passing scenario needs and which would hide extra output.
- A THEN the rule cannot read in full, including one that ends in further sentences, is listed SKIPPED with the THEN's text as its reason (28 at `11080b1`). Rejected: reading such trailing sentences as notes, which could pass a scenario on part of its claim.
- A scenario's GIVEN blocks are its fenced blocks before its WHEN line. A double-quoted string outside fences, other than in the WHEN and THEN lines, that names a scenario anywhere in current truth makes that scenario's blocks run first. Each block runs once per capability, and a named block current truth lacks makes its scenario SKIPPED.
- Every block and WHEN runs as `bash -c`, using the `bash` on `PATH`, from the top of the checkout under test, with stdin closed. The environment is the caller's, with every `FACTORY_` variable removed and HOME and TMPDIR set to fresh directories per capability. Capabilities run at the same time; within one, scenarios run in file order. This follows the standing decision that role processes never inherit `FACTORY_DISPATCH`.
- On a ticket's checkout, recognised by the store's own layout (`worktrees/<id>`, or `runs/<run>/wt` and that run's `meta.yaml`), the check folds the approved delta of that ticket's parent, or of the ticket itself if it has no parent. Rejected: a `{ticket}` placeholder in the gate command, which only an upgraded runtime would fill in.
- The check also folds the delta of every unarchived change whose ticket is not closed and has a merged sub-ticket, because that code is on `main` before its scenarios reach current truth. A closed ticket's unarchived change is not folded, as was decided for T-0030.
- A scenario in an ADDED or MODIFIED requirement of a folded delta is listed SKIPPED, naming the ticket, because that ticket's verifier checks it. Rejected: running the new forms, which fails a sub-ticket on scenarios a sibling has yet to build.
- A folded delta that no longer applies to current truth refuses the check with exit 2, naming the ticket.
- `factory truth check` only reads. Like `stats`, it skips the instance refusal, the live-store fence and the harness lock, and it refuses `--accept-harness`, which follows the 2026-10-23 standing decision on commands that skip the lock. The two live-store-guard requirements that list those commands are restated with `truth check` added.
- This instance's gate runs the integration checkout's `bin/factory` on the integration checkout's store, as its last gate command. This follows `gate_commands`' rule that a change cannot weaken its own gate. It also needs no runtime upgrade, because it runs `main`'s code, which is outside the harness lock. Rejected: the runtime's `bin/factory`, which would leave the gate broken between merge and upgrade.
- `--skip-when-contains TEXT` skips, and lists, each scenario whose WHEN contains TEXT. The gate passes the suite command's text.
- Answer 1 (operator, 2026-10-25, standing): the gate's replay skips the three scenarios that run the whole harness suite and have exact-print THENs, because the same gate already runs that suite. Every gate run lists them as skipped, and `factory truth check` without `--skip-when-contains` runs them. The same text matches ten suite-running scenarios whose THENs are prose, which are skipped either way; the gate lists all 13 with the WHEN reason, which is checked before the THEN. Rejected: running them in the gate (482 s at `3e4705a`, 80% of the ten-minute command limit), and leaving the gate unchanged for now.
- This change restates role-escalations' "The implementer and verifier leave declared protected paths out of ESCALATIONS" and harness-code's "Sharing an operation changes no refusal, park reason, event or parse result" with `--model` dropped from their setup, so the five scenarios T-0050 broke pass and the gate's first run is clean. The instance is the only source of a role's model, so the fixtures pass none.
- `factory/cli.py`'s limit rises from under 900 to under 910 lines, and the replay lives in `factory/truth.py`. Rejected: compressing unrelated lines to make room. T-0057 also adds lines to `cli.py`, so the new limit leaves room for both.
- README grows by at most 11 lines, so it stays within its 1,225-line budget beside T-0057's one line.
- The scenario that runs the check on this repo's live store names four capabilities. A standing scenario that replayed all of current truth would replay itself inside every later gate, and would double the gate's time.

## Risk

- Every later sub-ticket's implementer and verifier runs the new gate command: about 121 s to 157 s more per run on this machine (measured at `11080b1` and `3e4705a`), on top of the suite's 119 s.
- Any current-truth scenario that fails now blocks every merge until a ticket fixes or restates it. That is the point of the change. It also means a scenario that depends on the machine, such as one that needs `node`, fails every gate where that tool is missing.
- The gate runs whatever is in `~/dev/spec-factory`'s working tree and `.venv`, outside the harness lock. An uncommitted edit there, or a `.venv` out of step with `uv.lock`, changes every gate's replay.
- Scenarios run with the verifier's environment, minus `FACTORY_` variables. A scenario that writes outside its temporary directories can still do so; the replay adds no isolation the verifier lacked.
- A later scenario that runs `truth check` over a capability holding itself recurses until the command limit stops it. This spec's own scenarios avoid that, as its last Decision says; README warns.
- Restated requirements: this change restates two requirements each in harness-code and live-store-guard, and one in role-escalations. T-0057's delta adds requirements only, so neither change's delta touches the other's.
- T-0057's design adds lines to `cli.py` and requires it to stay under 900. At 899 lines, that holds only if this change merges first and raises the limit, or T-0057 frees lines.

Protected paths: `factory/truth.py`, `factory/cli.py`, `.factory/instance.yaml`

## Operator steps

1. After the merge, from `~/dev/spec-factory` on `main`, run the gate's replay once through the running-code wrapper: `bin/factory truth check --store .factory/store --skip-when-contains 'pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory'`. Its last line should report `0 failed`. If it does not, every later gate fails: file a ticket for the failing scenario, or take the entry out of `gate_commands` until one lands.

=== design.md
## Proposed change

The change is one PR of about 370 lines: `factory/truth.py` about 200, its tests about 150, and the rest small edits. Parts A and B are the command, C the gate entry, D the documents, and E the restated scenarios, which change only the spec store.

**A. `factory/truth.py`: the replay.** A new module. It imports `factory.specstore`, `factory.store` and `factory.instance`, never `factory.cli`. It reuses `specstore.lines_outside_fences`, `requirement_blocks`, `parse_delta` and `apply_delta` rather than redefining them. It must leave no unused import or name.

- **Inputs.** The store is `--store PATH` (relative paths from the caller's directory, as `stats` does), else `FACTORY_STATE`, else the store of the instance found from the caller's directory. Refuse with exit 2 when `<store>/openspec/specs` is not a directory: `truth check: <store> has no current truth (openspec/specs)`. The checkout under test is `git -C <caller's directory> rev-parse --show-toplevel`, resolved. Refuse when that fails: `truth check: <dir> is not inside a git checkout`. The caller's directory is `instance.caller_cwd()`.
- **Folding.** Find the ticket under test:
  - if the checkout's parent is `<store>/worktrees`, it is the checkout's name;
  - if the checkout is named `wt` and its grandparent is `<store>/runs`, it is the `ticket` in `<checkout>/../meta.yaml`;
  - otherwise there is none.

  Its change id is the `parent` in `<store>/tickets/<ticket>.yaml`, or the ticket itself when the file is missing or `parent` is null. Read only the `status` and `parent` keys of ticket files, so a file holding `id`, `status` and `parent` is enough.

  The folded set holds that change id if `openspec/changes/<id>/` exists. It also holds every directory directly under `openspec/changes/`, `archive` aside, whose own ticket's `status` is not `closed` and which has a ticket with `parent: <id>` and `status: merged`. Fold the set in id order. For each delta part `specs/<cap>/spec.md`, check it against the text folded so far, as `specstore.applies` checks a delta against files: an ADDED name must be absent, a MODIFIED or REMOVED name present. Then apply it with `apply_delta`. On any error, refuse: `truth check: the approved delta of <id> does not apply to current truth: <errors joined by "; ">`. Record every scenario name in an ADDED or MODIFIED block of a folded delta, with that delta's id; a later delta's id wins.
- **Parsing.** For each capability, in name order, split the folded text into scenario blocks. A block runs from a `#### Scenario: <name>` line to the next `##`, `###` or `####` heading outside fences. Within a block, outside fences:
  - the WHEN is the one line starting `- WHEN `, and its command is the text between the line's first and last backtick;
  - the THEN is the one line starting `- THEN `, with the first fenced block after it when the line ends `lines:`;
  - the GIVEN blocks are the bodies of the fenced blocks that open before the WHEN line;
  - the references are the double-quoted strings on lines other than the WHEN and THEN lines that equal a scenario name anywhere in folded truth, looked up in the same capability first, then in capability order.
- **The exact-print rule** reads the THEN text after `- THEN `:
  ```text
  THEN  := "it prints " ["exactly " | "only "] BODY [", one per line"] [" and exits 0" | ", and exits 0"] ["."]
  BODY  := "these " N " lines:"                     expected = the lines of the fenced block after the THEN
         | [["these "] N " lines" [", one per line"] ": "] LIST
         | WORD " lines, each " ["exactly "] ITEM [", then " LIST]    WORD is two..ten; ITEM repeats WORD times
  LIST  := ITEM ((", then " | ", and " | ", " | " and ") ITEM)*
  ITEM  := "`" text with no backtick "`" [", twice" | ", three times"] [" (" note with no backtick or parenthesis ")"]
  ```
  N is digits or a word, and its value is not checked. Expected lines are the ITEM texts in order, verbatim, spaces included. The WHEN passes when its stdout, decoded as UTF-8 with errors replaced, with one trailing newline removed and split at `\n` (empty output is no lines), equals the expected lines. With "and exits 0", its exit status must also be 0; otherwise the status is not compared. Stderr is never compared.
- **Skips**, checked in this order; the first that applies gives the reason:
  1. In a folded delta: `in the approved delta of <id>, which that ticket's verifier checks`.
  2. No WHEN line: `has no WHEN line`. More than one: `has more than one WHEN line`. Fewer than two backticks, or an empty command: `its WHEN is not one backticked command`.
  3. A `--skip-when-contains` text in the command: `its WHEN contains "<text>", which this run skips`.
  4. On a line outside fences containing `GIVEN block`, a double-quoted string that names no scenario: `needs the GIVEN block of "<name>", which current truth does not hold`.
  5. No THEN line, or one the rule cannot read in full: `THEN is not an exact print: <THEN text after "- THEN ">`, or `has no THEN line`.
- **Running.** Each capability gets a fresh directory from `tempfile.mkdtemp`, holding `home/` and `tmp/`, removed at the end. Its scenarios that are not skipped run in file order. Before each one's WHEN, the GIVEN blocks it needs run, in order: each reference's needs first, recursively and never twice on one path, then its own. A block that already ran in this capability is not run again. Every block and WHEN runs as `subprocess.run(["bash", "-c", text], cwd=<checkout>, stdin=DEVNULL, capture_output=True)`. The environment is `os.environ` less every `FACTORY_*` name, with `HOME=<dir>/home` and `TMPDIR=<dir>/tmp`. GIVEN exit statuses are ignored. Capabilities run at the same time, one thread each, through `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`. There is no time limit.
- **Output** goes to stdout, in capability name order and file order, after everything has run:
  - first line: `truth check: <checkout> against <store>; folded: <ids joined by ", ">`, or `folded: none`;
  - one line per reported scenario: `PASS <cap>: <name>`, `FAIL <cap>: <name>` or `SKIPPED <cap>: <name>: <reason>`;
  - under each FAIL, lines that start with two spaces: `  expected:`, then each expected line indented four spaces; `  got:`, then each stdout line indented four spaces, at most 40, then `    … <k> more lines`; `  exit <status>`; and, when stderr is not empty, `  stderr:` and its last five lines indented four spaces;
  - last line: `<n> scenarios: <p> passed, <f> failed, <s> skipped; wall time <t> s`, where t is the whole seconds from the start of parsing to the end of the last run, rounded down.

  The command returns 1 when f > 0, else 0.
- **`--capability NAME`**, repeatable, reports and runs only those capabilities. Their GIVEN references into other capabilities still resolve and run. A name with no `openspec/specs/<name>/spec.md` is refused: `truth check: no capability <name> in current truth`. `--skip-when-contains TEXT` is repeatable.

**B. `factory/cli.py`: the command.** Add the parser `truth` with the required subcommand `check`, its options `--store`, `--capability` and `--skip-when-contains`, and its function from `factory/truth.py`. Put the parser's construction in `factory/truth.py` behind one call from `build_parser()` if that keeps `cli.py` under 910 lines. In `main()`, add `"truth"` to both `("init", "paths", "stats")` tuples, so it refuses `--accept-harness` with the same message and runs before the instance refusal, fence and lock. Return the function's exit code. Add `("truth", "check")` to `READ_ONLY` and update its comment. `cli.py` must stay under 910 lines.

**C. `.factory/instance.yaml`: the gate entry.** After the suite command, add a comment line and this last entry:
```text
  # then current truth, replayed by the integration checkout's harness; WHENs that run the suite are skipped, since the line above runs it
  - "{integration}/bin/factory truth check --store {integration}/.factory/store --skip-when-contains 'pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory'"
```
`gate_commands()` already replaces `{integration}` with the checkout that has `main` (`factory/compose.py:92-99`). The gate-commands scenario that reads the suite entry matches only a line that starts `  - "uv run` and ends `tests/factory"`, so it still finds one line.

**D. Documents.** The new lines and headings are these, verbatim:
```text
### Replaying current truth with `factory truth check`
- **Replaying current truth, `factory truth check`.**
**Replaying current truth.**
```
- README, "Where a human decides": the read-only list ends `log tail`, `truth check`, `paths` and `stats`. Keep `paths` and `stats` adjacent, which a current-truth scenario greps.
- README: the subsection headed by the first line above, after "Counting what each role catches and costs" and before "## What is built and what is not". In at most six lines of text it says:
  - what the command replays and against which checkout;
  - how a THEN is read (the exact-print rule, with a pointer to `docs/design.md`), and that skipped scenarios are listed with reasons and counted;
  - `--capability` and `--skip-when-contains`;
  - which deltas it folds, and why;
  - that this instance's gate runs it as its last command;
  - that a scenario must not replay a capability that holds it.

  It quotes no figure.
- README "Built": one entry of at most two lines, opening with the second line above and naming "Replaying current truth with".
- README "Accepting a harness revision": add `truth check` to the one sentence that says `init`, `paths` and `stats` refuse `--accept-harness`. Keep it one sentence, so the current-truth count of such sentences stays 1.
- README grows by at most 11 lines.
- `docs/design.md`: a paragraph opening with the third line above, immediately before the paragraph opening `**Routing table.**`. It states the command, the exact-print rule, the skip reasons, the fold, the per-capability environment and the gate entry.
- `docs/design.md`, the paragraph opening `**Only the dispatcher writes a live store during a run.**`: its read-only list ends `log tail`, `truth check`, `paths` and `stats`.
- `docs/design.md`, the paragraph opening `**Role-context block.**`: in its `harness.lock` clause, the sentence on commands that refuse `--accept-harness` names `truth check` too.
- `docs/changelog.md`: one entry, numbered next with no gap, naming #120. It records:
  - the command and the gate entry;
  - the wall-time figures from this spec's Evidence;
  - the five scenarios restated and why;
  - what was rejected: the runtime's binary, a `{ticket}` placeholder, running a delta's new scenarios, and a contains match.

**E. Restated scenarios, spec store only.** The MODIFIED requirements below change current truth at archive and need no code. The verifier runs each of their scenarios.

**Tests.** A new file, `tests/factory/test_truth.py`, covers the exact-print rule's forms, the skip reasons, the fold and the refusals. It must not change any existing test, and it must keep the suite under three minutes. A test may build a store from files, as the acceptance fixture does.

## Tests to change

none. No test pins `READ_ONLY` or the lock-exempt commands as a whole. `tests/factory/test_small_defects.py:99` and `:121` test the `--accept-harness` refusal for `init`, `paths` and `stats` by name, and still pass. The `cli.py` limit is a current-truth scenario, not a test, and is restated under E. No test reads this repo's `.factory/instance.yaml`.

=== specs/truth-check/spec.md
## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: factory truth check replays each current-truth scenario under bash in the checkout under test and fails on a wrong print
`factory truth check` SHALL run, under `bash`, from the top of the git checkout that holds the caller's directory, the WHEN of every current-truth scenario it can read, after the GIVEN blocks that scenario needs. It SHALL compare the WHEN's standard output with the THEN by the exact-print rule, and print one line per scenario: `PASS`, `FAIL` or `SKIPPED`, its capability and its name. It SHALL also print the expected and printed lines under each failure, and a last line with the counts and the wall time in seconds. It MUST exit 1 when any scenario fails, and 0 otherwise. The first line SHALL name the checkout, the store and the folded deltas. `--capability NAME`, repeatable, SHALL limit the run to those capabilities. Capabilities SHALL run at the same time, each in its own fresh HOME and TMPDIR, with no `FACTORY_` variable in its scenarios' environment. An unknown capability, a store with no `openspec/specs`, and a caller outside a git checkout MUST be refused with exit 2.

#### Scenario: Each scenario of a fixture truth gets one result line, and the last line counts them and gives the wall time
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `git` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the fixture file written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

- THEN it prints exactly `one: exit=0 2 2`, then `unknown: exit=2 named=1`, then `no-truth: exit=2`, then `no-git: exit=2`

#### Scenario: Capabilities run at the same time

### Requirement: A scenario the check cannot run mechanically is listed as skipped with its reason and counted
A scenario whose THEN the exact-print rule cannot read in full, whose named GIVEN block current truth does not hold, or whose WHEN contains a text given with `--skip-when-contains` MUST be listed as `SKIPPED` with its reason, and counted as skipped in the last line. It MUST never be counted as passed.

gamma: Gamma prints one, then ten: in the approved delta of T-0002, which that ticket's verifier checks
16 scenarios: 10 passed, 2 failed, 4 skipped; wall time N s
```

### Requirement: On a ticket's checkout the check folds that ticket's approved delta, and every unarchived delta with merged code, before it runs
When the checkout under test is a ticket's implementer worktree (`<store>/worktrees/<id>`) or checker checkout (`<store>/runs/<run>/wt`), `factory truth check` SHALL fold into current truth the approved delta of that ticket's parent, or of the ticket itself when it has no parent, as archive folds it. From any checkout it SHALL also fold the delta of every change not yet archived whose ticket is not closed and has a merged sub-ticket. Each scenario in an ADDED or MODIFIED requirement of a folded delta SHALL be listed SKIPPED, naming that ticket. A folded delta that does not apply to current truth MUST be refused with exit 2, naming its ticket, and no scenario run.

#### Scenario: On a checker's checkout of a sub-ticket its parent's delta is folded and the delta's own scenarios are skipped
Needs the GIVEN block of "Each scenario of a fixture truth gets one result line, and the last line counts them and gives the wall time" run once. On T-0001.1's branch the greeting is `hello, world`, which T-0001's delta expects; current truth still expects `hello`.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0059-truth.sh && cd $K && check; head -1 $T/o | sed "s#$K#K#; s#$S#S#"; grep -E '^(PASS|FAIL|SKIPPED) (alpha: The greeting|gamma: )' $T/o; tail -1 $T/o | sed -E 's/wall time [0-9]+ s$/wall time N s/')`
- THEN it prints exactly these 5 lines:

```
truth check: K against S; folded: T-0001, T-0002
SKIPPED alpha: The greeting names the world: in the approved delta of T-0001, which that ticket's verifier checks
SKIPPED gamma: Gamma prints one, then ten: in the approved delta of T-0002, which that ticket's verifier checks
PASS gamma: Gamma prints two
16 scenarios: 10 passed, 2 failed, 4 skipped; wall time N s
```

#### Scenario: The implementer's worktree folds the same deltas
Needs the GIVEN block of "Each scenario of a fixture truth gets one result line, and the last line counts them and gives the wall time" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0059-truth.sh && cd $W && check; head -1 $T/o | sed "s#$W#W#; s#$S#S#"; grep -E '^(PASS|FAIL|SKIPPED) alpha: The greeting' $T/o)`
- THEN it prints exactly `truth check: W against S; folded: T-0001, T-0002`, then `SKIPPED alpha: The greeting names the world: in the approved delta of T-0001, which that ticket's verifier checks`

#### Scenario: From the integration branch only an open ticket's delta with a merged sub-ticket is folded
Needs the GIVEN block of "Each scenario of a fixture truth gets one result line, and the last line counts them and gives the wall time" run once. T-0001 has nothing merged, T-0003 is closed and T-0004 has nothing merged; T-0004's delta would remove "Gamma counts".
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0059-truth.sh && cd $G && check; grep -E '^(PASS|FAIL|SKIPPED) (alpha: The greeting|gamma: )' $T/o)`
- THEN it prints exactly `PASS alpha: The greeting is printed exactly`, then `SKIPPED gamma: Gamma prints one, then ten: in the approved delta of T-0002, which that ticket's verifier checks`, then `PASS gamma: Gamma prints two`

#### Scenario: A folded delta that no longer applies is refused, naming its ticket, and nothing runs
Needs the GIVEN block of "Each scenario of a fixture truth gets one result line, and the last line counts them and gives the wall time" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0059-truth.sh && printf 'id: T-0005\nstatus: planned\nparent: null\n' > $S/tickets/T-0005.yaml && printf 'id: T-0005.1\nstatus: merged\nparent: T-0005\n' > $S/tickets/T-0005.1.yaml && mkdir -p $S/openspec/changes/T-0005/specs/gamma && printf '## MODIFIED Requirements\n\n### Requirement: Gamma is gone\nGamma SHALL go.\n' > $S/openspec/changes/T-0005/specs/gamma/spec.md && cd $G && check; echo "exit=$(cat $T/x) named=$(grep -c T-0005 $T/e) results=$(grep -cE '^(PASS|FAIL|SKIPPED) ' $T/o)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `exit=2 named=1 results=0`

### Requirement: truth check only reads, so it runs during a run, from inside the store and under any harness revision, and refuses --accept-harness
`factory truth check` MUST run on an instance's own store while a run is in flight there, from inside that store's `runs/`, and when the instance's `harness.lock` names another revision, and it MUST write nothing to the store or the instance. With no `--store` it SHALL read the store of the instance found from the caller's directory. Given `--accept-harness`, it MUST be refused with exit 2 and `{"ok": false, …}` on stdout, naming `factory --accept-harness <sha> config` with the same sha.

#### Scenario: truth check reads a live store with a run in flight, from inside its runs/, under another harness revision, and writes nothing
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" (current truth, live-store-guard) run once. T-0001's triage run is in flight on the target's own store, and the lock is overwritten to name another revision, so an ordinary read is refused.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-inflight.sh && mkdir -p $S/openspec/specs && echo 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 > $T/tgt/.factory/harness.lock && S0=$(snap); cd $T/tgt && $B truth check > $T/o1 2>&1; a=$?; cd $W && $B truth check --store $S > $T/o2 2>&1; b=$?; cd $T/tgt && $B ticket show T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1; c=$?; echo "here=$a inside=$b store=$([ "$(snap)" = "$S0" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed) total=$(tail -1 $T/o1 | sed 's/;.*//') locked=$c")`
- THEN it prints exactly `here=0 inside=0 store=unchanged total=0 scenarios: 0 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped locked=2`

#### Scenario: truth check refuses --accept-harness and names config
Needs the GIVEN block of "Each scenario of a fixture truth gets one result line, and the last line counts them and gives the wall time" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0059-truth.sh && cd $G && $B --accept-harness 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567 truth check --store $S > $T/o 2>$T/e; echo "exit=$? hint=$(grep -cF 'factory --accept-harness 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567 config' $T/e) json=$(tail -1 $T/o | grep -c '"ok": false')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `exit=2 hint=1 json=1`

=== specs/gate-commands/spec.md
## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: This instance's gate replays current truth with the integration checkout's harness
`.factory/instance.yaml` SHALL list, as its last gate command, `factory truth check` run by the integration checkout's `bin/factory` on the integration checkout's store, skipping each scenario whose WHEN runs the harness suite. On this change's checkout and this repo's live store, the check SHALL report no failure in the capabilities this change restates or whose scenarios reuse a restated fixture.

#### Scenario: The instance's last gate command is the truth check on the integration checkout's store
- WHEN `(sed -n '/^gate_commands:/,/^[a-z_]*:/p' .factory/instance.yaml | grep '^  - ' | tail -1)`
- THEN it prints exactly `  - "{integration}/bin/factory truth check --store {integration}/.factory/store --skip-when-contains 'pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory'"`

#### Scenario: The truth check on this checkout reports no failure in the capabilities this change restates
Run from the checkout under test, a worktree of this repo, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `git` and `node` on `PATH`. The store is this repo's live store, found from the checkout's git common directory. It names four capabilities so that, once in current truth, it never replays itself.

- THEN it prints exactly `exit=0 failed=0`

=== specs/harness-docs/spec.md
## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The documents record the truth check
README SHALL add `truth check` to "Where a human decides"'s read-only list, keeping `paths` and `stats` adjacent. It SHALL hold a subsection "Replaying current truth with `factory truth check`" under "Where a human decides" and a Built entry that points to it.

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The implementer and verifier leave declared protected paths out of ESCALATIONS
The system prompt of every implementer and verifier run SHALL say that a protected path the sub-ticket declares is not an escalation, that the code reviewer lists declared paths once for each head it reviews, that the role may name them but not under ESCALATIONS, and that a protected path the sub-ticket does not declare still goes under ESCALATIONS.

#### Scenario: Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the fixture file written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

{"ok": false, "error": "run-0001-triage is not a PLANNED planner run of T-0001"}
```

#### Scenario: The dispatcher parks a refused store command with the same reason
Needs the GIVEN block of "Status transitions write the same events and history entries" run once. `factory drive` runs for real on the throwaway store. T-0001.1's implementer run start is refused because the target repository does not exist. T-0001.2 sits at its checks with no branch. T-0002 is at its planner with no approved spec.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0046-store.sh && bin/factory approve-spec T-0001 >/dev/null && printf 'ST-1 / A\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n\nST-2 / B\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T/plan.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T/plan.md >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to planned --by t >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket set T-0001.2 status=checks-in-flight >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req2.md >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket set T-0002 status=ready-for-planner >/dev/null && bin/factory drive T-0001 --phase build >/dev/null 2>&1; bin/factory drive T-0002 --phase build >/dev/null 2>&1; for x in T-0001.1 T-0001.2 T-0002; do uv run --frozen python ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0046-reason.py $FACTORY_STATE $x; done)`

#### Scenario: The spec parser gives the same result as the base on every spec in the store
Needs the GIVEN block of "Status transitions write the same events and history entries" run once.
- WHEN `(uv run --frozen python ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0046-specstore.py)`
- THEN it prints one line, `files=<n> checks=<m> differ=0`, with n and m above 0, and nothing after it

#### Scenario: The refactored harness has no unused imports or variables
- WHEN `uvx ruff check --select F401,F841 factory tests`
- THEN it prints `All checks passed!` and exits 0

#### Scenario: The harness suite passes and no existing test file changes
Per the standing T-0023 decision, the command gives pytest its own temporary directory under `/tmp` and removes it when it ends.
- WHEN `(P=$(mktemp -d /tmp/t0046-suite.XXXXXX) && TMPDIR=$P uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | tail -1; rm -rf "$P"; git diff --name-only --diff-filter=DMR main...HEAD -- tests)`
- THEN it prints one line, which reports a number of passed tests and no `failed` or `error`, and nothing after it

### Requirement: The command-line code has one module per job
The harness's command-line code SHALL be split by job: the spec-drift checks in
`factory/drift.py`, setup in `factory/setup.py`, the gates in `factory/gates.py`, the human
decisions in `factory/human.py`, the current-truth replay in `factory/truth.py`, and the helpers more than one of them uses, with the live-store
fence, in `factory/common.py`. `factory/cli.py` MUST keep the parser, the entry point and the role
list, and be under 910 lines.

Run every command of this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after
`uv sync --frozen`, with `git` on `PATH`.

#### Scenario: The drift checks live in factory/drift.py
- WHEN `uv run --frozen python -B -c 'import factory.drift' && grep -oE '^(def [A-Za-z_]+|[A-Z_]+ =)' factory/drift.py | sed 's/^def //; s/ =$//' | LC_ALL=C sort | paste -sd' ' -`

#### Scenario: The human decisions live in factory/human.py
- WHEN `uv run --frozen python -B -c 'import factory.human' && grep -oE '^(def [A-Za-z_]+|[A-Z_]+ =)' factory/human.py | sed 's/^def //; s/ =$//' | LC_ALL=C sort | paste -sd' ' -`

#### Scenario: factory/cli.py keeps the parser, the entry point and the role list, in under 910 lines
- WHEN `echo "$(wc -l < factory/cli.py | tr -d ' ') $(grep -cE '^(def build_parser\(|def main\(|ROLES = )' factory/cli.py)"`
- THEN it prints two numbers: the first below 910, the second `3`

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Unmarked writes to a live store are refused while a role run is in flight there
While any run is in flight on an instance's own store, every `factory` command on that store except `ticket show`, `ticket join`, `results show`, `config`, `launch-script`, `status parse`, `log tail`, `truth check`, `paths`, `drive` and `stats`, none of them given `--accept-harness`, MUST be refused with exit 2, writing nothing to the store, the instance or the repository, unless its environment has `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1`; the refusal SHALL name a throwaway `FACTORY_STATE` and SHALL NOT name the marker.

#### Scenario: Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.

- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-inflight.sh && E=$($B decision add T-0001 x 2>&1 >/dev/null); J=$($B decision add T-0001 x 2>/dev/null | tail -1); cd $W && E2=$(FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 $B decision add T-0001 x 2>&1 >/dev/null); echo "rule=$(echo "$E" | grep -c 'role runs may not write the live store') state=$(echo "$E" | grep -c FACTORY_STATE) marker=$(echo "$E$J$E2" | grep -c FACTORY_DISPATCH) json=$(echo "$J" | grep -c '"ok": false') inside=$(echo "$E2" | grep -c 'role runs may not write the live store')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `rule=1 state=1 marker=0 json=1 inside=1`

#### Scenario: A harness acceptance is refused while a run is in flight
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-inflight.sh && A=$(cat $T/tgt/.factory/harness.lock) && S0=$(snap); $B --accept-harness $A ticket show T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "accept=$? store=$([ "$(snap)" = "$S0" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `accept=2 store=unchanged`

#### Scenario: A launch copy is written unmarked while a run is in flight, and the target is unchanged
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once. The unmarked `ticket new` beside it shows the fence is up.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-inflight.sh && mkdir $T/tmp && S0=$(snap); TMPDIR=$T/tmp $B launch-script build >/dev/null 2>&1; l=$?; $B ticket new --file $T/req2.md >/dev/null 2>&1; n=$?; echo "launch=$l new=$n copies=$(ls $T/tmp | grep -c '^factory-launch-') store=$([ "$(snap)" = "$S0" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `launch=0 new=2 copies=1 store=unchanged`

### Requirement: init, paths and stats refuse --accept-harness and name a command that accepts it
`factory --accept-harness <sha>` given with `init`, `paths`, `stats` or `truth check` MUST be refused with exit 2 and `{"ok": false, …}` on stdout, writing nothing. The refusal SHALL name the command and give `factory --accept-harness <sha> config` with the same sha. Without the flag, `paths`, `stats` and `truth check` SHALL still run under a lock that names another revision, and every other command SHALL keep its lock behaviour.

#### Scenario: The flag with init, paths or stats is refused, names config, and writes nothing, even where init would create an instance
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; Z=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567; snap() { find . -path ./.git -prune -o -type f -exec cksum {} + | sort | cksum; }; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && git init -q -b main $T/fresh && git -C $T/fresh -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && S0=$(snap) && for c in init paths stats; do $B --accept-harness $Z $c >$T/o 2>$T/e; echo "$c: exit=$? named=$(grep -cw "$c" $T/e) hint=$(grep -cF -- "factory --accept-harness $Z config" $T/e) json=$(grep -c '"ok": false' $T/o)"; done; echo "target=$([ "$(snap)" = "$S0" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)"; cd $T/fresh && $B --accept-harness $Z init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "fresh: exit=$? files=$(find . -path ./.git -prune -o -type f -print | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `init: exit=2 named=1 hint=1 json=1`, `paths: exit=2 named=1 hint=1 json=1`, `stats: exit=2 named=1 hint=1 json=1`, `target=unchanged`, `fresh: exit=2 files=0`, one per line

#### Scenario: Without the flag paths and stats still run under another lock, and config still accepts a revision
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && R=$($B paths | sed -n 's/.*"harness_revision": "\([0-9a-f]*\)".*/\1/p') && echo 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 > .factory/harness.lock && $B paths >/dev/null 2>&1; p=$?; $B stats >/dev/null 2>&1; s=$?; $B config >/dev/null 2>&1; c=$?; $B --accept-harness $R config >/dev/null 2>&1; a=$?; echo "paths=$p stats=$s config=$c accept=$a lock=$([ "$(cat .factory/harness.lock)" = "$R" ] && echo accepted || echo other)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `paths=0 stats=0 config=2 accept=0 lock=accepted`

## Acceptance

- Each scenario of a fixture truth gets one result line, and the last line counts them and gives the wall time → NEW. Today it prints only `exit=2`: `factory` has no `truth` command (`argument cmd: invalid choice: 'truth'`).
- The first line names the checkout, the store and the folded deltas, and a failure shows what was expected and what was printed → NEW. Today it prints nothing, because the command writes nothing to stdout.
- --capability limits the run, and an unknown capability, a store with no current truth and a caller outside git are refused → NEW. Today its first two lines are `one: exit=2 0 0` and `unknown: exit=2 named=0`.
- Capabilities run at the same time → NEW. Today it prints nothing.
- Prose THENs, missing GIVEN blocks and WHENs the caller skips are listed with their reasons and counted as skipped → NEW. Today it prints nothing.
- On a checker's checkout of a sub-ticket its parent's delta is folded and the delta's own scenarios are skipped → NEW. Today it prints nothing.
- The implementer's worktree folds the same deltas → NEW. Today it prints nothing.
- From the integration branch only an open ticket's delta with a merged sub-ticket is folded → NEW. Today it prints nothing.
- A folded delta that no longer applies is refused, naming its ticket, and nothing runs → NEW. Today it prints `exit=2 named=0 results=0`: the refusal is argparse's, which names no ticket.
- truth check reads a live store with a run in flight, from inside its runs/, under another harness revision, and writes nothing → NEW. Today it prints a line starting `here=2 inside=2 store=unchanged total=factory: error: argument cmd: invalid choice: 'truth'`: argparse refuses the unknown command.
- truth check refuses --accept-harness and names config → NEW. Today it prints `exit=2 hint=0 json=0`.
- The instance's last gate command is the truth check on the integration checkout's store → NEW. Today it prints `  - "uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory"`.
- The truth check on this checkout reports no failure in the capabilities this change restates → NEW. Today it prints `exit=2` and a space, because `factory` has no `truth` command.
- README, the design doc and the changelog describe the truth check → NEW. Today it prints `readonly=no section=no built=no accepting=no design=no design-fence=no changelog=0`.
- Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule → REGRESSION. It passes today and after; this change restates its requirement, and the verifier runs it.
- Status transitions write the same events and history entries → REGRESSION. It passes today and after; this change restates its requirement, and the verifier runs it.
- Spec pinning and planner-run refusals keep their text → REGRESSION. It passes today and after; this change restates its requirement, and the verifier runs it.
- The dispatcher parks a refused store command with the same reason → REGRESSION. It passes today and after; this change restates its requirement, and the verifier runs it.
- The spec parser gives the same result as the base on every spec in the store → REGRESSION. It passes today and after; this change restates its requirement, and the verifier runs it.
- The refactored harness has no unused imports or variables → REGRESSION. It passes today and after; this change restates its requirement, and the verifier runs it.
- The harness suite passes and no existing test file changes → REGRESSION. It passes today and after; this change restates its requirement, and the verifier runs it.
- The drift checks live in factory/drift.py → REGRESSION. It passes today and after; this change restates its requirement, and the verifier runs it.
- The shared helpers and the live-store fence live in factory/common.py → REGRESSION. It passes today and after; this change restates its requirement, and the verifier runs it.
- Instance and store setup live in factory/setup.py → REGRESSION. It passes today and after; this change restates its requirement, and the verifier runs it.
- The gates live in factory/gates.py → REGRESSION. It passes today and after; this change restates its requirement, and the verifier runs it.
- The human decisions live in factory/human.py → REGRESSION. It passes today and after; this change restates its requirement, and the verifier runs it.
- factory/cli.py keeps the parser, the entry point and the role list, in under 910 lines → REGRESSION. It passes today and after; this change restates its requirement, and the verifier runs it.
- Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included → REGRESSION. It passes today and after; this change restates its requirement, and the verifier runs it.
- The refusal names the throwaway store and not the marker → REGRESSION. It passes today and after; this change restates its requirement, and the verifier runs it.
- A harness acceptance is refused while a run is in flight → REGRESSION. It passes today and after; this change restates its requirement, and the verifier runs it.
- A launch copy is written unmarked while a run is in flight, and the target is unchanged → REGRESSION. It passes today and after; this change restates its requirement, and the verifier runs it.
- The flag with init, paths or stats is refused, names config, and writes nothing, even where init would create an instance → REGRESSION. It passes today and after; this change restates its requirement, and the verifier runs it.
- Without the flag paths and stats still run under another lock, and config still accepts a revision → REGRESSION. It passes today and after; this change restates its requirement, and the verifier runs it.

## Responses

No critic findings yet. This version follows the operator's Answer 1 (option a), which the previous version already assumed. It moves the question into Decisions, re-measures on `main` at `11080b1` with T-0056 archived, extends the exact-print rule to the "N lines:" form T-0056's scenarios use, and adds two fixture scenarios for that form.

## Current truth: gate-commands

# gate-commands

## Requirements

### Requirement: A gate command may declare its paths and is skipped for a sub-ticket that touches none of them
Each `gate_commands` entry SHALL be a command string or a mapping of `command` and an optional `paths` list of git pathspecs. When a reviewer or verifier run starts on a sub-ticket, the harness MUST mark SKIPPED, with its reason, each command whose paths the diff from base to head touches none of. It MUST list that command apart from the commands to run, and record it in the run's `meta.yaml`. A command with no `paths` SHALL always be listed to run.

#### Scenario: A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the fixture file written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

```sh
cat > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-sub.sh <<'EOF'
# Sourced from the repo root, with $1 the file the sub-ticket's one commit changes (docs/b.md or
# src/a.txt) and $2 `scoped` or `plain`. Builds a scratch instance and target. `scoped` gives the
# gate the unscoped command `git diff --check main...HEAD` and the command `sh -c 'exit 7'` scoped
# to `src/`; `plain` keeps the fixture's one unscoped command. Sub-ticket T-0001.1 reaches
# checks-in-flight with that commit as its head; a verifier run is started and composed on it.
# Leaves $B (the CLI), $T, $I (the implementer run), $R and $V (the verifier run and its
# directory), $H (the head) and $COMPOSE (that compose's exit code).
T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory
mkdir $T/inst && cp tests/factory/fixtures/instance/context.md $T/inst/
grep -v '^gate_commands:' tests/factory/fixtures/instance/instance.yaml > $T/inst/instance.yaml
if [ "$2" = scoped ]; then
  printf '%s\n' 'gate_commands:' '  - "git diff --check main...HEAD"' "  - {command: \"sh -c 'exit 7'\", paths: [\"src/\"]}" >> $T/inst/instance.yaml

- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-sub.sh docs/b.md scoped && echo "compose=$COMPOSE run=$(grep -F 'Gate commands' $V/input.md 2>/dev/null | grep -F 'git diff --check main...HEAD' | grep -vc 'exit 7') skipped=$(grep '^SKIPPED' $V/input.md 2>/dev/null | grep -F 'exit 7' | grep -c 'src/') meta=$(grep -c 'exit 7' $V/meta.yaml | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `compose=0 run=1 skipped=1 meta=1`

#### Scenario: A diff that touches a scoped command's paths runs that command
Needs the GIVEN block of "A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-sub.sh src/a.txt scoped && echo "compose=$COMPOSE run=$(grep -F 'Gate commands' $V/input.md 2>/dev/null | grep -F 'git diff --check main...HEAD' | grep -cF 'exit 7') skipped=$(grep -c '^SKIPPED' $V/input.md 2>/dev/null)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `compose=0 run=1 skipped=0`

#### Scenario: A gate command with no paths runs on every diff, as today
Needs the GIVEN block of "A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-sub.sh docs/b.md plain && echo "compose=$COMPOSE run=$(grep -F 'Gate commands' $V/input.md | grep -cF 'git diff --check main...HEAD') skipped=$(grep -c '^SKIPPED' $V/input.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `compose=0 run=1 skipped=0`

### Requirement: A skipped command is recorded on the gate result, and the merge still needs that result to pass
When a verifier's result is recorded, the `ci` row MUST list each command that verifier run skipped, with status SKIPPED and its reason. `factory merge` SHALL still refuse unless that row is PASS.

#### Scenario: A skipped gate command is recorded on the gate result, and the merge still needs a passing gate
Needs the GIVEN block of "A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-sub.sh docs/b.md scoped && for g in FAIL PASS; do printf 'Commit: %s\nGate suite: %s\nSTATUS: VERIFIED\nCONFIDENCE: high, fixture\nESCALATIONS: none\n' $H $g > $T/v.md; printf 'Commit: %s\nSTATUS: APPROVE\nCONFIDENCE: high, fixture\nESCALATIONS: none\n' $H > $T/r.md; $B results record T-0001.1 --head $H --role verifier --output $T/v.md --run $R >/dev/null; $B results record T-0001.1 --head $H --role reviewer --output $T/r.md --run run-0003-reviewer >/dev/null; $B merge T-0001.1 >/dev/null 2>&1; m=$?; C=$T/store/results/$H/ci.yaml; echo "$g: merge=$m recorded=$(grep -q 'exit 7' $C && grep -q SKIPPED $C && echo yes || echo no)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `FAIL: merge=2 recorded=yes`, then `PASS: merge=0 recorded=yes`

### Requirement: The implementer is given every gate command
The implementer's input SHALL list every gate command to run, scoped or not, and no SKIPPED line.

#### Scenario: The implementer is still given every gate command
Needs the GIVEN block of "A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-sub.sh docs/b.md scoped && $B run compose $I >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "compose=$? both=$(grep -F 'Gate commands' $T/store/runs/$I/input.md 2>/dev/null | grep -F 'git diff --check main...HEAD' | grep -cF 'exit 7') skipped=$(grep -c '^SKIPPED' $T/store/runs/$I/input.md 2>/dev/null)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `compose=0 both=1 skipped=0`

### Requirement: A malformed gate entry refuses every build role's run start
A `gate_commands` entry MUST make `run start` refuse with exit 2 for the implementer, reviewer or verifier, naming `gate_commands` and creating no run, when it is anything other than one of these: a string; or a mapping with a non-empty string `command`, an optional non-empty list of non-empty strings `paths`, and no other key.

#### Scenario: A malformed gate entry refuses a checker's run start and creates no run
Needs the GIVEN block of "A gate command scoped to paths is skipped for a diff that touches none of them" run once.
- WHEN `(for bad in '{command: "true", path: ["src/"]}' '{command: "true", paths: "src/"}'; do (. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0028-sub.sh docs/b.md plain && grep -v '^gate_commands:' $T/inst/instance.yaml > $T/i.yaml && echo "gate_commands: [$bad]" >> $T/i.yaml && mv $T/i.yaml $T/inst/instance.yaml && n=$(ls $T/store/runs | wc -l) && $B run start --role reviewer --ticket T-0001.1 >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? new_runs=$(( $(ls $T/store/runs | wc -l) - n )) named=$(grep -c 'gate_commands' $T/err)"); done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `exit=2 new_runs=0 named=1`, twice

### Requirement: The gate's suite command finishes in under three minutes
The harness-suite command in this repository's `gate_commands` SHALL, run as written, pass every test and finish in under 180 seconds on the operator's machine.

#### Scenario: The gate's suite command, as the instance lists it, passes in under three minutes
Needs the GIVEN block of "One suite run passes in under three minutes" (this change, harness-suite) run once.
- WHEN `(C=$(sed -n 's/^  - "\(uv run .*tests\/factory\)"$/\1/p' .factory/instance.yaml); echo "gate: $C"; .venv/bin/python ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0051-time.py 1 180 "$C")`
- THEN it prints exactly `gate: uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory`, then one line that reports a number of passed tests, contains no `failed` or `error`, and ends with `| under 180 s`

## Current truth: harness-code

# harness-code

## Requirements

### Requirement: The harness keeps no definition, setting or comment that nothing uses or that is no longer true
The harness source under `factory/` SHALL carry no definition that nothing calls or reads, no instance setting that no code reads, and no comment or message that describes behaviour the harness no longer has. It MUST keep every behaviour that a command can reach. Its checks on the command-line code read `factory/cli.py` and the five modules split from it: `common.py`, `drift.py`, `gates.py`, `human.py` and `setup.py`.

#### Scenario: The four dead definitions are gone and nothing names them
- WHEN `echo "$(grep -nE '^(def run_gates\(|STATES = |OPS = |def load_config\()' factory/gitops.py factory/store.py factory/specstore.py | wc -l | tr -d ' ') $(grep -rnF --include='*.py' -e 'gitops.run_gates' -e 'store.STATES' -e 'specstore.OPS' -e 'store.load_config' factory tests | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"`
- THEN it prints `0 0`

#### Scenario: No harness or test file names the force-push setting
- WHEN `grep -rn --exclude-dir=__pycache__ force_push_allowed factory tests | wc -l | tr -d ' '`
- THEN it prints `0`

#### Scenario: Run start carries one intake-and-implementer in-flight refusal, no rename and one store-ignore write
- WHEN `echo "$(cat factory/cli.py factory/common.py factory/drift.py factory/gates.py factory/human.py factory/setup.py 2>/dev/null | grep -c prompt_name) $(cat factory/cli.py factory/common.py factory/drift.py factory/gates.py factory/human.py factory/setup.py 2>/dev/null | grep -c "already has run {t\[.in_flight.\]\[0\]} in flight") $(cat factory/cli.py factory/common.py factory/drift.py factory/gates.py factory/human.py factory/setup.py 2>/dev/null | grep -c 'store.ensure_gitignore(root)')"`
- THEN it prints `0 2 2`

#### Scenario: No harness module has three blank lines in a row
- WHEN `awk 'FNR==1{n=0} /^$/{n++; if(n==3) print FILENAME":"FNR; next} {n=0}' factory/*.py | wc -l | tr -d ' '`
- THEN it prints `0`

#### Scenario: The three stale texts are gone
- WHEN `grep -nF -e 'commit-and-push' -e 'live pilot store is unaffected' -e 'not supported yet' factory/*.py | wc -l | tr -d ' '`
- THEN it prints `0`

#### Scenario: The repo-root helper takes no argument and every caller passes none
- WHEN `echo "$(grep -n 'repo_root(cfg' factory/*.py | wc -l | tr -d ' ') $(grep -o 'gitops.repo_root()' factory/*.py | wc -l | tr -d ' ') $(grep -c '^def repo_root() -> Path:$' factory/gitops.py)"`
- THEN it prints `0 12 1`

#### Scenario: The harness has no unused imports or variables
- WHEN `uvx ruff check --select F401,F841 factory tests`
- THEN it prints `All checks passed!` and exits 0

#### Scenario: The harness suite passes, and only the force-push test lines change under tests
Per the standing T-0023 decision, the command gives pytest its own temporary directory under `/tmp` and removes it when it ends.
- WHEN `(P=$(mktemp -d /tmp/t0044-suite.XXXXXX) && TMPDIR=$P uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | tail -1; rm -rf "$P"; git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- tests)`
- THEN the first line reports a number of passed tests and no `failed` or `error`, and every later line, if any, is `tests/factory/fixtures/instance/instance.yaml` or `tests/factory/test_instance.py`

### Requirement: Each operation the harness repeated has one definition
The harness SHALL define once each of the following: listing a ticket's runs, reading the event log (one reader for the CLI, one inside the standalone cost script), recording a status transition outside spec approval, listing the runs in flight on a ticket and its sub-tickets, reading the integration-branch tip, copying a resolution record, setting aside failed result rows, checking for a PLANNED planner run, refusing a spec that does not validate and apply, formatting a dispatcher park for a failed store command, and cleaning up a checker run. Every caller MUST use that definition. Its checks on the command-line code read `factory/cli.py` and the five modules split from it: `common.py`, `drift.py`, `gates.py`, `human.py` and `setup.py`.

#### Scenario: Only the store module lists a ticket's runs
- WHEN `cat factory/cli.py factory/common.py factory/drift.py factory/gates.py factory/human.py factory/setup.py factory/compose.py factory/specstore.py 2>/dev/null | grep -cE 'runs\.(iterdir|glob)\(|"runs"\)\.(iterdir|glob)\('`
- THEN it prints `0`

#### Scenario: The CLI and the stats report read the event log through a shared reader
- WHEN `echo "$(cat factory/cli.py factory/common.py factory/drift.py factory/gates.py factory/human.py factory/setup.py factory/stats.py 2>/dev/null | grep -c '"\*\.jsonl"') $(grep -c '"\*\.jsonl"' factory/store.py)"`
- THEN it prints `0 1`

#### Scenario: One function records a status transition outside spec approval
- WHEN `echo "$(cat factory/cli.py factory/common.py factory/drift.py factory/gates.py factory/human.py factory/setup.py 2>/dev/null | grep -c '"ticket\.transition"') $(grep -c '"ticket\.transition"' factory/store.py)"`
- THEN it prints `1 1`

#### Scenario: Neither spec amend nor the dispatcher builds the in-flight list itself
- WHEN `cat factory/cli.py factory/common.py factory/drift.py factory/gates.py factory/human.py factory/setup.py factory/drive.py 2>/dev/null | grep -cE 'for \w+ in \(t, \*'`
- THEN it prints `0`

#### Scenario: One function reads the integration-branch tip
- WHEN `echo "$(cat factory/*.py | grep -cE 'rev\(repo, (gitops\.)?integration_branch\(') $(grep -c '^def integration_tip(' factory/gitops.py)"`
- THEN it prints `1 1`

#### Scenario: Record copies, row set-asides, planner-run checks and spec apply checks each have one definition
- WHEN `echo "$(cat factory/cli.py factory/common.py factory/drift.py factory/gates.py factory/human.py factory/setup.py 2>/dev/null | grep -c 'shutil\.copyfile(a\.') $(cat factory/cli.py factory/common.py factory/drift.py factory/gates.py factory/human.py factory/setup.py 2>/dev/null | grep -c '"results\.superseded"') $(cat factory/cli.py factory/common.py factory/drift.py factory/gates.py factory/human.py factory/setup.py 2>/dev/null | grep -c 'is not a PLANNED planner run') $(cat factory/cli.py factory/common.py factory/drift.py factory/gates.py factory/human.py factory/setup.py 2>/dev/null | grep -c 'specstore\.applies(root, deltas)')"`
- THEN it prints `0 1 1 1`

#### Scenario: One line formats a failed-command park and one call cleans up a checker
- WHEN `echo "$(grep -cE "harness-bug: .*stderr" factory/drive.py) $(grep -c 'call("run", "cleanup"' factory/drive.py) $(grep -cE '^def _(harness_bug|cleanup_checker)\(' factory/drive.py)"`
- THEN it prints `1 1 2`

### Requirement: Sharing an operation changes no refusal, park reason, event or parse result
After the operations above are shared, every command MUST print the same refusals, write the same events, history entries and park reasons, and parse every spec the same way as before, and the existing harness tests SHALL pass with no existing test file changed.

#### Scenario: Status transitions write the same events and history entries
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `git` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the three fixture files written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names them reuses them)

{"ok": false, "error": "run-0001-triage is not a PLANNED planner run of T-0001"}
```

#### Scenario: The dispatcher parks a refused store command with the same reason
Needs the GIVEN block of "Status transitions write the same events and history entries" run once. `factory drive` runs for real on the throwaway store. T-0001.1's implementer run start is refused because the target repository does not exist. T-0001.2 sits at its checks with no branch. T-0002 is at its planner with no approved spec.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0046-store.sh && bin/factory approve-spec T-0001 >/dev/null && printf 'ST-1 / A\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n\nST-2 / B\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T/plan.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T/plan.md >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to planned --by t >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket set T-0001.2 status=checks-in-flight >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req2.md >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket set T-0002 status=ready-for-planner >/dev/null && bin/factory drive T-0001 --phase build >/dev/null 2>&1; bin/factory drive T-0002 --phase build >/dev/null 2>&1; for x in T-0001.1 T-0001.2 T-0002; do uv run --frozen python ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0046-reason.py $FACTORY_STATE $x; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly these 3 lines:

T-0002 'harness-bug: plan whole-spec: T-0002 has no approved spec\n'
```

#### Scenario: The spec parser gives the same result as the base on every spec in the store
Needs the GIVEN block of "Status transitions write the same events and history entries" run once.
- WHEN `(uv run --frozen python ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0046-specstore.py)`
- THEN it prints one line, `files=<n> checks=<m> differ=0`, with n and m above 0, and nothing after it

#### Scenario: The refactored harness has no unused imports or variables
- WHEN `uvx ruff check --select F401,F841 factory tests`
- THEN it prints `All checks passed!` and exits 0

#### Scenario: The harness suite passes and no existing test file changes
Per the standing T-0023 decision, the command gives pytest its own temporary directory under `/tmp` and removes it when it ends.
- WHEN `(P=$(mktemp -d /tmp/t0046-suite.XXXXXX) && TMPDIR=$P uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | tail -1; rm -rf "$P"; git diff --name-only --diff-filter=DMR main...HEAD -- tests)`
- THEN it prints one line, which reports a number of passed tests and no `failed` or `error`, and nothing after it

### Requirement: The command-line code has one module per job
The harness's command-line code SHALL be split by job: the spec-drift checks in
`factory/drift.py`, setup in `factory/setup.py`, the gates in `factory/gates.py`, the human
decisions in `factory/human.py`, and the helpers more than one of them uses, with the live-store
fence, in `factory/common.py`. `factory/cli.py` MUST keep the parser, the entry point and the role
list, and be under 900 lines.

Run every command of this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after
`uv sync --frozen`, with `git` on `PATH`.

#### Scenario: The drift checks live in factory/drift.py
- WHEN `uv run --frozen python -B -c 'import factory.drift' && grep -oE '^(def [A-Za-z_]+|[A-Z_]+ =)' factory/drift.py | sed 's/^def //; s/ =$//' | LC_ALL=C sort | paste -sd' ' -`
- THEN it prints exactly `TEST_FILE_RE TICK_RE _check_drift _check_sibling_tests _sibling_drift _test_drift _tests_to_change_section`

#### Scenario: The shared helpers and the live-store fence live in factory/common.py
- WHEN `uv run --frozen python -B -c 'import factory.common' && grep -oE '^(def [A-Za-z_]+|[A-Z_]+ =)' factory/common.py | sed 's/^def //; s/ =$//' | LC_ALL=C sort | paste -sd' ' -`
- THEN it prints exactly `_add_spec_version _in_flight _integration_head _rel fence out`

#### Scenario: Instance and store setup live in factory/setup.py
- WHEN `uv run --frozen python -B -c 'import factory.setup' && grep -oE '^(def [A-Za-z_]+|[A-Z_]+ =)' factory/setup.py | sed 's/^def //; s/ =$//' | LC_ALL=C sort | paste -sd' ' -`
- THEN it prints exactly `STATE_DIR_LINE _add_store_checkout _copy_mismatch _exclude_store _git_toplevel _head_branch _ignored_files _new_instance_yaml _refuse_inside_store _revision _store_hint init_cmd paths_cmd store_migrate`

#### Scenario: The gates live in factory/gates.py
- WHEN `uv run --frozen python -B -c 'import factory.gates' && grep -oE '^(def [A-Za-z_]+|[A-Z_]+ =)' factory/gates.py | sed 's/^def //; s/ =$//' | LC_ALL=C sort | paste -sd' ' -`
- THEN it prints exactly `DECLARED_RE MAX_CONFLICT_RUNS REVIEWER_STATUSES VERIFIER_STATUSES _branch_tip _in_repo _parent_close_verified _reused_subticket_run _verifier_rows archive_cmd declared_paths merge_cmd results_record results_show ticket_head ticket_join ticket_parent_check undeclared_protected`

#### Scenario: The human decisions live in factory/human.py
- WHEN `uv run --frozen python -B -c 'import factory.human' && grep -oE '^(def [A-Za-z_]+|[A-Z_]+ =)' factory/human.py | sed 's/^def //; s/ =$//' | LC_ALL=C sort | paste -sd' ' -`
- THEN it prints exactly `_approval_dir _by _copy_record _next_n _refuse_unless_applies _restart_note _set_aside_failed_rows _supersede approve_spec decision_add escape_add intervention_add request_changes resolve spec_amend`

#### Scenario: factory/cli.py keeps the parser, the entry point and the role list, in under 900 lines
- WHEN `echo "$(wc -l < factory/cli.py | tr -d ' ') $(grep -cE '^(def build_parser\(|def main\(|ROLES = )' factory/cli.py)"`
- THEN it prints two numbers: the first below 900, the second `3`

### Requirement: Splitting the command-line code changes no definition
Across this change, every top-level function, class and assignment in `factory/*.py` SHALL keep
its exact source text, wherever it ends up, and the change MUST add at most 100 lines to
`factory/*.py` in total.

#### Scenario: Every definition keeps its exact text, and the split adds at most 100 lines
The command compares each `Merge factory/T-0047.<n>` commit reachable from HEAD with its first
parent, and `git merge-base HEAD main` with HEAD, and adds up the results. Changes other tickets
make to the same files are therefore never counted.
- GIVEN the script written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown

```sh
cat > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0047-moved.py <<'EOF'
# uv run --frozen python -B t0047-moved.py, from the repo root. Compares factory/*.py across each
# `Merge factory/T-0047.<n>` commit reachable from HEAD against its first parent, and across
# `git merge-base HEAD main` against HEAD, so other tickets' changes are never counted. Per pair it
# takes every top-level function, class and assignment by its exact source text, in whichever
# factory/*.py file holds it. Prints `pairs=<n> added=<a> removed=<r> lines=<l>`: a definition whose
# text changed counts once in each of added and removed; lines is the change in the files' total
# line count, summed over the pairs. Then the first line of up to ten definitions that differ.
import ast, collections, subprocess
def git(*a): return subprocess.run(["git", *a], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True).stdout
def scan(rev):
    c, lines = collections.Counter(), 0
    for path in git("ls-tree", "--name-only", rev, "factory/").split():
        if path.endswith(".py"):
            src = git("show", f"{rev}:{path}"); lines += src.count("\n")
            for n in ast.parse(src).body:
                if isinstance(n, (ast.FunctionDef, ast.AsyncFunctionDef, ast.ClassDef, ast.Assign, ast.AnnAssign)):
                    c[ast.get_source_segment(src, n)] += 1
    return c, lines
pairs = [(m + "^1", m) for m in git("log", "--format=%H", "--grep=^Merge factory/T-0047[.]", "HEAD").split()]

    added += list((n - o).elements()); removed += list((o - n).elements()); lines += ln - lo
print(f"pairs={len(pairs)} added={len(added)} removed={len(removed)} lines={lines}")
for d in (added + removed)[:10]: print(d.splitlines()[0])
EOF
```

- WHEN `(uv run --frozen python -B ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0047-moved.py)`
- THEN it prints one line, `pairs=<n> added=0 removed=0 lines=<l>`, with n at least 1 and l at most 100, and nothing after it

### Requirement: Only the entry point, the driver and the stats report import the CLI module
No harness module SHALL import `factory.cli` except `factory/__main__.py`, `factory/drive.py` and
`factory/stats.py`. `main`, `build_parser` and `ROLES` MUST stay importable from `factory.cli`.

#### Scenario: Only the entry point, the driver and the stats report import the CLI module
- WHEN `grep -lE '^\s*(from factory\.cli import|import factory\.cli|from factory import ([^#]*, )?cli\b)' factory/*.py | paste -sd' ' -`
- THEN it prints exactly `factory/__main__.py factory/drive.py factory/stats.py`

#### Scenario: The CLI's entry points stay importable
- WHEN `uv run --frozen python -B -c 'import factory.cli, factory.drive, factory.stats; from factory.cli import main, build_parser, ROLES; print(len(ROLES), callable(main), callable(build_parser))'`
- THEN it prints exactly `7 True True`

### Requirement: The split harness passes its suite and its name checks
After the split, the harness suite SHALL pass with no test file changed, and the harness source
MUST have no undefined, unused or redefined name.

#### Scenario: The split harness has no undefined, unused or redefined names
- WHEN `uvx ruff check --select F factory`
- THEN it prints `All checks passed!` and exits 0

#### Scenario: After the split the harness suite passes with no test file changed
Per the standing T-0023 decision, the command gives pytest its own temporary directory under
`/tmp` and removes it when it ends.
- WHEN `(P=$(mktemp -d /tmp/t0047-suite.XXXXXX) && TMPDIR=$P uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | tail -1; rm -rf "$P"; git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- tests)`
- THEN it prints one line, which reports a number of passed tests and no `failed` or `error`, and nothing after it

## Current truth: harness-docs

# harness-docs

## Requirements

### Requirement: The documents record the change
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold entry 51 covering every part and stay numbered without a gap, and `README.md` SHALL describe the new `resolve` behaviour and relative environment paths.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the change in order
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; sed -n '/^51\. /p' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e BLOCKED -e '--replan' -e 'next free' -e 'error text' -e redispatch -e '-whitespace' -e context.md -e relative -e uncommitted | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `9`

#### Scenario: The README describes the new resolve verbs
- WHEN `(echo "replan=$(grep -c -- '--replan' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') gap=$(grep -c 'has no .resolve. verb' README.md)")`
- THEN it prints `replan=1 gap=0`

#### Scenario: The README says relative paths resolve from the caller's directory
- WHEN `(grep -c 'relative .FACTORY_' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')`
- THEN it prints `1`

### Requirement: The documents record the live-store guard
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #45 recording the guard, numbered without a gap; `docs/design.md` SHALL describe the dispatcher marker and the run-directory rule; README's "Where a human decides" SHALL open with the marker's exact command form and say that the refusal deliberately does not name it; README SHALL say the final verifier run is listed as in flight and SHALL no longer say the factory's capabilities never entered the spec store.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the guard in one entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; E=$(grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #45 ' docs/changelog.md); printf '%s\n' "$E" | grep -c .; printf '%s' "$E" | grep -oF -e FACTORY_DISPATCH -e 'in flight' -e throwaway -e 'exit 2' -e 'worktrees/' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`, then `5`

#### Scenario: The design doc names the marker and the run-directory rule
- WHEN `(echo "design=$(grep -c FACTORY_DISPATCH docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') dirs=$(grep FACTORY_DISPATCH docs/design.md | grep -c 'worktrees/' | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design=1 dirs=1`

#### Scenario: README tells the operator how to write during a run, first thing under Where a human decides
- WHEN `(H=$(sed -n '/^## Where a human decides/,/^## What is built/p' README.md); J=$(echo "$H" | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "first=$(echo "$H" | sed -n '3p' | grep -c 'FACTORY_DISPATCH=1') command=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 [^ ]*bin/factory ') unnamed=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'deliberately does not name the marker') export=$(echo "$J" | grep -ci 'never export') rundirs=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'worktrees/')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `first=1 command=1 unnamed=1 export=1 rundirs=1`

#### Scenario: README says the final verifier run is listed as in flight
- WHEN `(R=$(tr '\n' ' ' < README.md | tr -s ' '); echo "stale=$(echo "$R" | grep -o 'does not list it as in flight' | grep -c .) listed=$(echo "$R" | grep -o 'lists it as in flight' | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `stale=0 listed=1`

#### Scenario: README no longer says the factory's capabilities never entered the spec store
- WHEN `(echo "bullet=$(grep -c 'Current truth for the factory itself' README.md) stale=$(grep -c 'never entered it' README.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `bullet=1 stale=0`

### Requirement: The documents describe the store branch
The design doc SHALL name the store branch `factory-store` and the never-tracked path rule. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one contiguously numbered entry recording the change. `README.md` SHALL describe committing the store on its branch, `factory store migrate`, the `git clean -ffdx` hazard and a checkout from before the move, and SHALL no longer say that a store commit moves the integration branch or give `.factory/state/` as the live store's location.

#### Scenario: The design doc names the store branch and the path rule
- WHEN `(Q=$(printf '\140'); echo "store_branch=$(grep -c 'factory-store' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') tickets_branch=$(grep -c "${Q}tickets${Q} branch" docs/design.md) never_tracked=$(grep -c 'never tracked' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints `store_branch=1 tickets_branch=0 never_tracked=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records the store branch in one contiguous entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep -E '^[0-9]+\. ' docs/changelog.md | grep 'factory-store' | grep -c 'never tracked')`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`

#### Scenario: The README describes the store branch and the move
`old_cost` joins the page into one line first, because the retired clause is wrapped across two lines. `old_refs` counts only the places that give the live store's location, so a how-to may still name the path a store moves from.
- WHEN `(Q=$(printf '\140'); echo "store_branch=$(grep -c 'factory-store' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') migrate=$(grep -c 'factory store migrate' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') ffdx=$(grep -c -- '-ffdx' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') premove=$(grep -c 'from before the move' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') old_cost=$(tr '\n' ' ' < README.md | grep -c 'committing the store to the same branch') old_refs=$(grep -c "\.factory/state/\(log\|tickets\)\|(${Q}\.factory/state/${Q})\|at ${Q}\.factory/state/${Q}" README.md)")`
- THEN it prints `store_branch=1 migrate=1 ffdx=1 premove=1 old_cost=0 old_refs=0`

### Requirement: The planner labels checks per sub-ticket and may list tests an earlier sibling added
Every copy of the planner prompt (the `docs/design.md` §4 block, `docs/prompts/04-planner.md`, `factory/prompts/planner.md`) SHALL tell the planner to label each check against the sub-ticket's own base, to name interim tests, and to list a sibling-added test as `` `<file>[::<test>]` (added by <sibling ID>): <reason> ``; it MUST no longer say to label checks "the same way", and the design block and its `docs/prompts/` copy SHALL stay byte-identical.

#### Scenario: Every planner copy labels per sub-ticket and lists sibling tests
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-planner.txt; sed -n '/^## 4\. Planner/,/^## 5\. /p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/04-planner.md factory/prompts/planner.md; do echo "own=$(grep -c "against this sub-ticket's own base" $f) sibling=$(grep -cF '(added by <sibling ID>)' $f) interim=$(grep -c '^  Interim tests: ' $f) copied=$(grep -c 'labelled NEW or REGRESSION the same way' $f)"; done; cmp -s $X docs/prompts/04-planner.md && echo verbatim || echo differs)`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `own=1 sibling=1 interim=1 copied=0`, then `verbatim`

### Requirement: The spec writer lists the tests a decision overturns, and the critic checks for one left off
Every copy of the spec writer prompt SHALL carry the RULES bullet that starts `- Tests a decision overturns: `, and every copy of the critic prompt SHALL say under rubric 1 that a test pinning the old behaviour and `missing from "Tests to change" is a finding`.

#### Scenario: Every spec writer and critic copy carries the decision-overturns rule
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-sw.txt; for h in '2\. Spec writer' '3\. Spec critic'; do sed -n "/^## $h/,/^## [0-9]/p" docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p"; done > $X; echo "design: writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' $X) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' $X)"; echo "docs/prompts: writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md)"; echo "factory/prompts: writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' factory/prompts/spec_writer.md) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' factory/prompts/critic.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design: writer=1 critic=1`, then `docs/prompts: writer=1 critic=1`, then `factory/prompts: writer=1 critic=1`

### Requirement: The preamble and the code reviewer accept a checked sibling entry
Every copy of the preamble SHALL allow an existing test listed `in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling`, and every copy of the code reviewer prompt SHALL not block a test `the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling`.

#### Scenario: Every preamble and reviewer copy accepts a sibling entry
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-pr.txt; for h in 'Shared preamble' '6\. Code reviewer'; do sed -n "/^## $h/,/^## [0-9A-Z]/p" docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p"; done > $X; echo "design: guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' $X) review=$(grep -c 'or the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling' $X)"; echo "docs/prompts: guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' docs/prompts/00-preamble.md) review=$(grep -c 'or the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling' docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md)"; echo "factory/prompts: guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' factory/prompts/preamble.md) review=$(grep -c 'or the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling' factory/prompts/reviewer.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design: guard=1 review=1`, then `docs/prompts: guard=1 review=1`, then `factory/prompts: guard=1 review=1`

### Requirement: Role runs receive the new rules
The system prompt that `run start` writes for a planner, spec writer and critic run SHALL contain that role's new rule and the new preamble sentence.

#### Scenario: Planner, spec writer and critic runs get the new rules in their system prompts
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s; for i in 1 2 3; do printf "# F$i\n\nDo x.\n" > $T/req$i.md; bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req$i.md >/dev/null; done; bin/factory ticket set T-0001 status=ready-for-planner >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0002 status=ready-for-spec-writer >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0003 status=ready-for-critic >/dev/null; for p in planner:T-0001 spec_writer:T-0002 critic:T-0003; do bin/factory run start --role ${p%%:*} --ticket ${p##*:} >/dev/null 2>&1; done; P=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-planner/system-prompt.txt); W=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-spec_writer/system-prompt.txt); C=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-critic/system-prompt.txt); echo "planner own=$(grep -c "against this sub-ticket's own base" $P) sibling=$(grep -cF '(added by <sibling ID>)' $P) guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' $P) writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' $W) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' $C)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `planner own=1 sibling=1 guard=1 writer=1 critic=1`

### Requirement: The documents record the sibling-tests check
`docs/design.md` SHALL describe the check in a paragraph that starts `**Tests a sibling added.**`, in piece 8 and in the spec approval gate row, and SHALL no longer call the gate's list the only authorization to alter an existing test; `docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold an entry for issue #40 and stay numbered without a gap; and `README.md` SHALL describe the check and the new `--ruling` case.

#### Scenario: The design doc describes the check
- WHEN `(echo "piece8=$(grep '^| 8 |' docs/design.md | grep -c 'added by that sibling') gate=$(grep '^| Spec approval |' docs/design.md | grep -c 'a test an earlier sibling added') stale=$(grep -c 'which is the only authorization to alter an existing test' docs/design.md) check=$(grep -c '^\*\*Tests a sibling added\.\*\*.*BLOCKED from harness:' docs/design.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `piece8=1 gate=1 stale=0 check=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records issue 40's change without a numbering gap
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #40 ' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e 'own base' -e 'added by' -e 'BLOCKED from harness' -e 'Decision' -e 'critic rubric 1' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: README describes the sibling tests check and its ruling
- WHEN `(echo "built=$(grep -c '^- \*\*Sibling tests check\.\*\*' README.md) ruling=$(grep '^| \*\*Unstick\*\*' README.md | grep -c 'a test no merged sibling added')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `built=1 ruling=1`

### Requirement: The documents record the declared-path rule
The "## 5. Implementer" and "## 7. Verifier" blocks of `docs/design.md` SHALL carry the declared-path rule and stay verbatim copies of `docs/prompts/05-implementer.md` and `docs/prompts/07-verifier.md`. The run copies under `factory/prompts/` SHALL differ from those files only by the fills they had on `main`. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #49, numbered without a gap.

#### Scenario: The design blocks and their copies carry the rule and stay in step
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); Q=$(printf '\140\140\140'); for r in "5. Implementer|05-implementer.md|implementer" "7. Verifier|07-verifier.md|verifier"; do h=${r%%|*}; x=${r#*|}; c=${x%%|*}; f=${x#*|}; git show main:factory/prompts/$f.md > $T/a; git show main:docs/prompts/$c > $T/b; echo "$f copy=$(awk -v h="## $h" -v q="$Q" '$0==h{s=1;next} s&&$0==q"text"{p=1;next} p&&$0==q{exit} p' docs/design.md | cmp -s - docs/prompts/$c && echo SAME || echo DIFF) rule=$(tr '\n' ' ' < docs/prompts/$c | tr -s ' ' | grep -c 'A protected path the sub-ticket declares is not an escalation') fill=$([ "$(diff factory/prompts/$f.md docs/prompts/$c | grep '^[<>]')" = "$(diff $T/a $T/b | grep '^[<>]')" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer copy=SAME rule=1 fill=unchanged`, then `verifier copy=SAME rule=1 fill=unchanged`. `copy=SAME`: the design block equals its `docs/prompts/` file. `rule=1`: that file carries the rule. `fill=unchanged`: the run copy under `factory/prompts/` differs from the documented copy only where it did on `main`.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the declared-path rule in a contiguous entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep -E '^[0-9]+\. ' docs/changelog.md | grep -F '#49' | grep -c 'ESCALATIONS')`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`

### Requirement: The documents record the small-change lane
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #48 recording the lane, numbered without a gap. `docs/design.md` and `README.md` SHALL describe the whole-spec sub-ticket and gate-command paths.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the small-change lane in one entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; E=$(grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #48 ' docs/changelog.md); printf '%s\n' "$E" | grep -c .; printf '%s' "$E" | grep -oF -e 'paths' -e SKIPPED -e 'plan whole-spec' -e NEEDS-SPLIT -e seams | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`, then `5`

#### Scenario: The design doc and README describe both skips
- WHEN `(echo "design=$(grep -c 'whole-spec' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') gate=$(grep '^| 11 | Gate runner' docs/design.md | grep -c 'SKIPPED') readme=$(grep -c 'plan whole-spec' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') skipped=$(grep -c 'SKIPPED' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') stale=$(grep -c 'The build workflow runs the planner, which' README.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design=1 gate=1 readme=1 skipped=1 stale=0`

### Requirement: Every role is told to wait for its own commands
Every copy of the shared preamble SHALL carry the bullet that starts `- Run every command in the foreground and wait for it to finish.` and says `Never end your turn while a command you started is still running`. The design block and both files MUST stay byte-identical, and every role run's system prompt SHALL carry the bullet.

#### Scenario: Every preamble copy carries the wait rule and the copies stay identical
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-pre.txt; sed -n '/^## Shared preamble/,/^## [0-9]/p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/00-preamble.md factory/prompts/preamble.md; do echo "fg=$(grep -c '^- Run every command in the foreground and wait for it to finish\.$' $f) end=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $f | tr -s ' ' | grep -c 'Never end your turn while a command you started is still running')"; done; cmp -s $X docs/prompts/00-preamble.md && cmp -s docs/prompts/00-preamble.md factory/prompts/preamble.md && echo verbatim || echo differs)`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `fg=1 end=1`, then `verbatim`

#### Scenario: Implementer, reviewer and verifier run prompts carry the wait rule, and only the reviewer's carries the judge-the-diff rule
Needs the GIVEN block of "Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh && for r in implementer reviewer verifier; do P=$(prompt $r); echo "$r fg=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'Never end your turn while a command you started is still running') judge=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'Do not run the test suite or the gate commands')"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer fg=1 judge=0`, `reviewer fg=1 judge=1`, `verifier fg=1 judge=0`, one per line

### Requirement: The code reviewer judges the diff and leaves the suite and the gate to the verifier
Every copy of the code reviewer prompt SHALL say `Do not run the test suite or the gate commands: the verifier runs them on the same head`, and SHALL allow a narrow command that confirms a specific finding. The design block SHALL stay a verbatim copy of `docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md`, and the run copy SHALL differ from it only by the fills it had on `main`. The reviewer's composed input MUST NOT list the gate commands, while the implementer's and the verifier's inputs still SHALL.

#### Scenario: Every reviewer copy carries the rule and the copies stay in step
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-rev.txt; T=$(mktemp -d); sed -n '/^## 6\. Code reviewer/,/^## 7\. /p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md factory/prompts/reviewer.md; do J=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $f | tr -s ' '); echo "judge=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'Do not run the test suite or the gate commands: the verifier runs them on the same head') narrow=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'You may run a narrow command to confirm a specific finding')"; done; git show main:factory/prompts/reviewer.md > $T/a; git show main:docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md > $T/b; echo "copy=$(cmp -s $X docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md && echo SAME || echo DIFF) fill=$([ "$(diff factory/prompts/reviewer.md docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md | grep '^[<>]')" = "$(diff $T/a $T/b | grep '^[<>]')" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)")`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `judge=1 narrow=1`, then `copy=SAME fill=unchanged`

#### Scenario: The reviewer's input no longer hands it the gate commands, and the implementer's and verifier's still do
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "A reviewer that ends its turn waiting on its own commands is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT beside the verifier's passing rows" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-checks.sh && for r in reviewer verifier implementer; do [ $r = implementer ] && bin/factory ticket set T-0001.1 status=ready-for-implementer 'in_flight=[]' >/dev/null; R=$(bin/factory run start --role $r --ticket T-0001.1 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'); bin/factory run compose ${R:-none} >/dev/null 2>&1; I=$FACTORY_STATE/runs/${R:-none}/input.md; echo "$r gates=$(grep -c 'Gate commands (run each from your worktree' $I 2>/dev/null) told=$(grep -c 'The verifier runs the gate commands on this head; you do not run them' $I 2>/dev/null)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `reviewer gates=0 told=1`, `verifier gates=1 told=0`, `implementer gates=1 told=0`, one per line

### Requirement: The documents record the empty-output route
`docs/design.md` SHALL state the EMPTY-OUTPUT rule and its two routing-table rows, and SHALL list a second EMPTY-OUTPUT among the park reasons. `README.md` SHALL no longer say that a run is parked for exceeding a budget, and SHALL describe the empty-output retry. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold an entry for issue #41, numbered without a gap.

#### Scenario: The design doc states the EMPTY-OUTPUT rule, its rows and its park
- WHEN `(echo "rule=$(grep -c '^- A role run that ends without writing its output is EMPTY-OUTPUT' docs/design.md) rows=$(grep -c '^| Any role | EMPTY-OUTPUT' docs/design.md) parks=$(grep '^- A non-empty ESCALATIONS line' docs/design.md | grep -c 'a second EMPTY-OUTPUT in a row') kill=$(grep -c 'never recorded as a budget kill' docs/design.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `rule=1 rows=2 parks=1 kill=1`

#### Scenario: README drops the budget park and describes the empty-output retry
- WHEN `(echo "budget=$(grep -c 'exceeding its budget\|over budget' README.md) built=$(grep -c '^- \*\*Empty output\.\*\*' README.md) unstick=$(grep '^| \*\*Unstick\*\*' README.md | grep -c 'ended without output twice')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `budget=0 built=1 unstick=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records issue 41 without a numbering gap
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #41 ' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e EMPTY-OUTPUT -e foreground -e 'last message' -e 're-dispatched once' -e 'gate commands' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

### Requirement: The spec writer and the critic carry the turn-economy rules
Every copy of the spec writer prompt SHALL tell it to batch independent reads and commands, read line ranges once grep has found them, keep long output in a scratch file, and write the spec in as few writes as it can. Every copy of the critic prompt SHALL carry the same reading rules, its minimum spot-check, a rule that it runs no test suite, the rule for picking an acceptance command, a sentence allowing a small experiment in its scratch directory to confirm a finding, and the rule that turns a claim needing a suite run or a build of the change into a finding or a question; it MUST NOT cap a claim at a number of paths and commands or forbid a clone, worktree or prototype. Each design block MUST stay byte-identical to its `docs/prompts/` copy, and each run copy SHALL differ from it only as it did on `main`.

#### Scenario: Every critic copy drops the cap and the no-build rule and keeps the rest; every writer copy keeps its rules
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); Q=$(printf '\140\140\140'); printf '%s\n' 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn' 'read that line range, not the whole file' 'to a file in your scratch directory and grep or tail it' > $T/both; { cat $T/both; echo 'Write the spec in as few writes as you can'; } > $T/spec_writer; { cat $T/both; printf '%s\n' 'Spot-check at least 2 cited paths and 1 acceptance command yourself' 'Run no test suite' 'Pick an acceptance command that runs no test suite' 'small experiment in your scratch directory' 'is a finding for the writer, or a question'; } > $T/critic; printf '%s\n' 'Ground any one claim' 'build nothing' 'no clone, worktree or prototype' > $T/gone; for r in "2.

- THEN it prints exactly `spec_writer copy=SAME doc=4/4 run=4/4 gone=0 fill=unchanged`, then `critic copy=SAME doc=8/8 run=8/8 gone=0 fill=unchanged`. `doc` and `run` count the kept or added phrases found in the documented copy and the run copy, each joined into one line so a phrase may wrap; `gone` counts the removed phrases found in either.

### Requirement: Spec writer and critic runs receive the turn-economy rules
The system prompt that `run start` writes for a spec writer run SHALL contain the writer's turn-economy rule. The one it writes for a critic run SHALL contain the critic's reading rules, its no-suite rule and the sentence allowing a small scratch experiment, and MUST NOT contain the per-claim cap or the no-build rule.

#### Scenario: A critic run's prompt has the no-suite rule and the scratch allowance, and no cap or build ban
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s; for i in 1 2; do printf "# F$i\n\nDo x.\n" > $T/req$i.md; bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req$i.md >/dev/null; done; bin/factory ticket set T-0001 status=ready-for-spec-writer >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0002 status=ready-for-critic >/dev/null; bin/factory run start --role spec_writer --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1; bin/factory run start --role critic --ticket T-0002 >/dev/null 2>&1; W=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $FACTORY_STATE/runs/run-0001-spec_writer/system-prompt.txt | tr -s ' '); C=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $FACTORY_STATE/runs/run-0002-critic/system-prompt.txt | tr -s ' '); echo "spec_writer batch=$(printf "%s" "$W" | grep -c 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn') writes=$(printf "%s" "$W" | grep -c 'Write the spec in as few writes as you can')"; echo "critic batch=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn') suite=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Run no test suite') scratch=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'small experiment in your scratch directory') cap=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Ground any one claim') build=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'build nothing')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `spec_writer batch=1 writes=1`, then `critic batch=1 suite=1 scratch=1 cap=0 build=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the turn-economy change
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #73, numbered without a gap. `docs/principles.md` principle 2 SHALL name the critic's no-suite rule among its mechanisms and SHALL no longer say the critic builds nothing.

#### Scenario: Principle 2 names the critic's no-suite rule and no longer its build ban
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; P=$(sed -n '/^### 2\. /,/^### 3\. /p' docs/principles.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "entries73=$(grep -c '^[0-9]*\.

- THEN it prints exactly `CONTIGUOUS`, then `entries73=1 implemented=1 builds=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the critic revert
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #74, numbered without a gap, that records the replay result and the two removed rules. The Spiking section of `docs/principles.md` SHALL no longer bound the critic to two paths and one command or say it does not build, SHALL say the critic may run a small scratch check, SHALL say vetting a whole approach belongs to the spec writer or a spike, and SHALL record the replay.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the revert in one entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; E=$(grep '^[0-9]*\.

- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`, then `7`

#### Scenario: The Spiking section allows a small scratch check and records the replay
- WHEN `(X=$(sed -n '/^## Spiking/,$p' docs/principles.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "bound=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'two paths, one command') nobuild=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'it does not build') scratch=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'small scratch check') whole=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'vetting a whole approach belongs to the spec writer') replay=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'replay')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `bound=0 nobuild=0 scratch=1 whole=1 replay=1`

### Requirement: The documents record the capability index
The triage prompt's design block, its `docs/prompts/` copy and the runtime prompt SHALL each carry the `Capabilities:` output line. `docs/design.md` and the README's Triage, Spec writer and Spec critic rows MUST describe the capability index. `docs/changelog.md` MUST have an entry for issue #75.

#### Scenario: The prompt copies, design, README and changelog name the capability index
- WHEN `(echo "docs-copy=$(grep -c '^Capabilities:' docs/prompts/01-triage.md) runtime=$(grep -c '^Capabilities:' factory/prompts/triage.md) changelog=$(grep -c '^[0-9]*\. After issue #75 ' docs/changelog.md) design=$(grep -q 'capability index' docs/design.md && echo y || echo n) readme=$(grep -E '^\| (Triage|Spec writer|Spec critic) \(' README.md | grep -c 'capability index')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `docs-copy=1 runtime=1 changelog=1 design=y readme=3`

### Requirement: The documents describe the whole decision log for the spec writer, critic and planner
`docs/design.md` and the README's Spec writer, Spec critic and Planner rows MUST say that those roles receive the whole decision log, and neither MUST mention a decision index. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL have an entry for issue #78.

#### Scenario: The design, README and changelog describe the whole decision log and no decision index
- WHEN `(echo "design-index=$(grep -c 'decision index' docs/design.md) design-whole=$(grep -c 'They and the planner receive the whole decision log' docs/design.md) readme-index=$(grep -c 'decision index' README.md) readme-whole=$(grep -E '^\| (Spec writer|Spec critic|Planner) \(' README.md | grep -c 'the whole decision log') changelog=$(grep -c '^[0-9]*\. After issue #78 ' docs/changelog.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design-index=0 design-whole=1 readme-index=0 readme-whole=3 changelog=1`

### Requirement: The documents record superseded plans
`docs/design.md` SHALL say, in its rule for a sub-ticket closed by the human, that a new plan from a later approved version supersedes the earlier plan's unmerged sub-tickets. `README.md` SHALL carry a "Re-plan after a re-spec" bullet. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #77, numbered without a gap.

#### Scenario: The design doc, README and changelog record superseded plans
- WHEN `(echo "design=$(grep 'sub-ticket closed by the human' docs/design.md | grep -c supersede) readme=$(grep -c '^- \*\*Re-plan after a re-spec\.\*\*' README.md) changelog=$(grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #77 ' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e superseded -e planned_from -e 'Depends on' | sort -u | grep -c .) $(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design=1 readme=1 changelog=3 CONTIGUOUS`

### Requirement: The prompts tell the reviewer what the gate checks and the spec writer how to declare
Every copy of the code reviewer prompt (the `docs/design.md` §6 block, `docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md`, `factory/prompts/reviewer.md`) SHALL carry check 6's new last sentence and MUST NOT say `will require a human approval`. Every copy of the spec writer prompt SHALL give the `Protected paths:` line under Risk and the rule of one path or glob per entry with no brace lists. Each design block and its `docs/prompts/` file MUST stay byte-identical, and each `factory/prompts/` copy SHALL differ from its `docs/prompts/` file only where it did on `main`.

#### Scenario: Every reviewer prompt copy states what the merge gate checks
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0033-rev.txt; T=$(mktemp -d); sed -n '/^## 6\. Code reviewer/,/^## 7\. /p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md factory/prompts/reviewer.md; do J=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $f | tr -s ' '); echo "gate=$(echo "$J" | grep -c "The merge gate merges a path the approved spec's Risk section declares with no further approval, and refuses and parks one it does not declare") promise=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'will require a human approval')"; done; git show main:factory/prompts/reviewer.md > $T/a; git show main:docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md > $T/b; echo "copy=$(cmp -s $X docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md && echo SAME || echo DIFF) fill=$([ "$(diff factory/prompts/reviewer.md docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md | grep '^[<>]')" = "$(diff $T/a $T/b | grep '^[<>]')" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)")`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `gate=1 promise=0`, then `copy=SAME fill=unchanged`

#### Scenario: Every spec writer prompt copy gives the declaration line
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0033-sw.txt; T=$(mktemp -d); sed -n '/^## 2\. Spec writer/,/^## 3\. /p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md factory/prompts/spec_writer.md; do echo "reads=$(grep -c 'declared on one line the merge gate reads:$' $f) form=$(grep -c '^ *Protected paths: none | .<path or glob>., .<path or glob>.$' $f) braces=$(grep -c '^ *one path or glob per entry, no brace lists$' $f)"; done; git show main:factory/prompts/spec_writer.md > $T/a; git show main:docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md > $T/b; echo "copy=$(cmp -s $X docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md && echo SAME || echo DIFF) fill=$([ "$(diff factory/prompts/spec_writer.md docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md | grep '^[<>]')" = "$(diff $T/a $T/b | grep '^[<>]')" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)")`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `reads=1 form=1 braces=1`, then `copy=SAME fill=unchanged`

### Requirement: The documents record the protected-path rule at merge
`docs/design.md` SHALL drop the per-PR approval for protected paths, describe the declared-path rule in piece 8 and the Protected paths gate row, and route a reviewer ESCALATE back to its checks; `docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold an entry for issue #57 and stay numbered without a gap; and `README.md` SHALL describe the check and `--accept-paths`.

#### Scenario: The design doc drops the per-PR approval for protected paths
- WHEN `(echo "gates=$(grep -c 'a PR touching a protected path, the daily escalation queue' docs/design.md) either=$(grep -c 'A change to either needs a human approval record before it merges' docs/design.md) onpr=$(grep -c 'any other guardrail or protected path needs a human approval on the PR itself' docs/design.md) piece8=$(grep '^| 8 |' docs/design.md | grep -c 'Protected paths:') piece9=$(grep -c 'review protected PRs' docs/design.md) gaterow=$(grep '^| Protected paths |' docs/design.md | grep -c -- '--accept-paths') stale=$(grep -c 'records the piece-8 approval; the merge gate does not merge without it' docs/design.md) reviewer_rule=$(grep -c '^  - A reviewer ESCALATE returns to its checks' docs/design.md) old_route=$(grep -c 'or a reviewer ESCALATE returns to the implementer' docs/design.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `gates=0 either=0 onpr=0 piece8=1 piece9=0 gaterow=1 stale=0 reviewer_rule=1 old_route=0`

#### Scenario: The changelog records issue 57's change without a numbering gap
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #57 ' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e 'Risk' -e '--accept-paths' -e 'BLOCKED from merge gate' -e 'checks' -e 'Protected paths:' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: README describes the protected-path check and the new resolve verb
- WHEN `(echo "built=$(grep -c '^- \*\*Protected paths at merge\.\*\*' README.md) unstick=$(grep '^| \*\*Unstick\*\*' README.md | grep -c -- '--accept-paths') merges=$(sed -n '/^- \*\*Merges, one at a time\.\*\*/,/^- \*\*Setting up the store\.\*\*/p' README.md | grep -c 'Risk section' | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `built=1 unstick=1 merges=1`

### Requirement: The implementer, verifier, code reviewer, planner and triage carry the reading rules
Every copy of the implementer, verifier, code reviewer, planner and triage prompts (the `docs/design.md` block, its `docs/prompts/` file and the `factory/prompts/` run copy) SHALL carry the Turn economy paragraph in the critic's words, and MUST NOT carry the spec writer's `as few writes as you can`. Each design block MUST stay byte-identical to its `docs/prompts/` file, and each run copy SHALL differ from it only as it did on `main`.

#### Scenario: The five role prompts carry the critic's reading paragraph in every copy
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); Q=$(printf '\140\140\140'); P='Turn economy: every turn re-sends everything read so far, so a wasted turn or a long printout costs again on every later turn. Put independent reads and commands in one turn. Once grep has found the lines you need, read that line range, not the whole file.

- THEN it prints exactly five lines: `triage copy=SAME doc=1 run=1 writes=0 fill=unchanged`, then the same for `planner`, `implementer`, `reviewer` and `verifier`. `copy=SAME`: the design block equals its `docs/prompts/` file. `doc` and `run`: the documented copy and the run copy each carry the whole paragraph once, joined into one line so it may wrap. `writes=0`: neither carries the spec writer's one-write sentence. `fill=unchanged`: the run copy differs from the documented copy only where it did on `main`.

### Requirement: Runs of the five roles receive the reading rules
The system prompt that `run start` writes for an implementer, code reviewer, verifier, triage and planner run SHALL contain the Turn economy paragraph once, and MUST NOT contain `as few writes as you can`.

#### Scenario: Implementer, reviewer and verifier runs receive the reading paragraph
Needs the GIVEN block of "Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule" (current truth, role-escalations) run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh && P='Turn economy: every turn re-sends everything read so far, so a wasted turn or a long printout costs again on every later turn. Put independent reads and commands in one turn. Once grep has found the lines you need, read that line range, not the whole file.

- THEN it prints exactly `implementer preamble=1 economy=1 writes=0`, `reviewer preamble=1 economy=1 writes=0`, `verifier preamble=1 economy=1 writes=0`, one per line. `preamble=1` shows the run started and its prompt was read.

#### Scenario: Triage and planner runs receive the reading paragraph
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s; P='Turn economy: every turn re-sends everything read so far, so a wasted turn or a long printout costs again on every later turn.

- THEN it prints exactly `triage preamble=1 economy=1 writes=0`, then `planner preamble=1 economy=1 writes=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the reading rules for the five roles
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #76, numbered without a gap, naming the five roles and the operator's replay, and the changelog SHALL end with its closing "Declined:" line.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the reading rules for the five roles in one entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; E=$(grep '^[0-9]*\.

- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `entries=1 terms=7 footer=1`

### Requirement: The critic's rubric asks about cross-ticket dependencies
The critic's system prompt MUST tell it to check each scenario against approved changes not yet archived and to require the scenario's setup to hold whichever of the two merges first, and the runtime critic prompt SHALL stay a copy of `docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md` with its round placeholder filled.

#### Scenario: A critic run's system prompt carries the cross-ticket rule
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s; printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md; bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to ready-for-spec-writer --by t >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to ready-for-critic --by t >/dev/null; R=$(bin/factory run start --role critic --ticket T-0001 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'); echo "rule=$(grep -c 'whichever of the two merges first' $FACTORY_STATE/runs/${R:-none}/system-prompt.txt 2>/dev/null)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `rule=1`

#### Scenario: The runtime critic prompt stays a copy of the documented one
- WHEN `(diff <(sed 's/{2}/2/' docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md) factory/prompts/critic.md >/dev/null && echo copies=same || echo copies=differ)`
- THEN it prints exactly `copies=same`

### Requirement: The documents record spec amendment, spec drift and the cross-ticket check
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry, numbered without a gap, covering the amend command with its intent flag, the drift check and the critic's cross-ticket check; `docs/design.md` SHALL name `factory spec amend` and `--intent unchanged`, carry a Spec drift paragraph and give the critic the approved changes not yet archived in its routing row; and README SHALL list the command under "Where a human decides" and the feature under Built.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the change in one contiguous entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; E=$(grep '^[0-9]*\.

- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`, then `6`

#### Scenario: The design doc names the amend command, its intent flag, spec drift and the critic's new input
- WHEN `(echo "amend=$(grep -c 'factory spec amend' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') intent=$(grep -c -- '--intent unchanged' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') drift=$(grep -c '^\*\*Spec drift\.\*\*' docs/design.md) row=$(grep '^| Spec writer | READY-FOR-CRITIC' docs/design.md | grep -c 'not yet archived')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `amend=1 intent=1 drift=1 row=1`

#### Scenario: README lists the amend command and the drift check
- WHEN `(H=$(sed -n '/^## Where a human decides/,/^### What you read at each stop/p' README.md); B=$(sed -n '/^\*\*Built\*\*/,/^\*\*Not built\*\*/p' README.md); echo "amend=$(echo "$H" | grep -c 'factory spec amend' | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') intent=$(echo "$H" | grep -c -- '--intent' | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') built=$(echo "$B" | grep -c '^- \*\*Spec amendment and drift\.\*\*')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `amend=1 intent=1 built=1`

### Requirement: The documents record the environment sync and the dropped virtual environment
`docs/design.md` SHALL name `environment_sync` and say the wrapper drops `VIRTUAL_ENV`. `factory/instance.template.yaml` SHALL carry an `environment_sync` key. `README.md` SHALL name `environment_sync` and `VIRTUAL_ENV`. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #51 recording the change, numbered without a gap.

#### Scenario: The design doc, template and README name the sync and the dropped virtual environment
- WHEN `(echo "design=$(grep -c environment_sync docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') design_venv=$(grep -c VIRTUAL_ENV docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') template=$(grep -c '^environment_sync:' factory/instance.template.yaml) readme=$(grep -c environment_sync README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') readme_venv=$(grep -c VIRTUAL_ENV README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`

- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`, then `4`

### Requirement: The documents describe the driver
`README.md` MUST describe `factory drive` under "Starting a run", its `claude -p` role processes under "What depends on Claude Code", the driver among the built pieces and its status file in the store's file table, and SHALL no longer list per-role effort as not built; `docs/design.md` SHALL name the driver, and `docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold an entry for issue #65.

#### Scenario: The documents describe the driver
- WHEN `(y() { [ "$1" -gt 0 ] && echo yes || echo no; }; r=README.md; echo "starting=$(y $(sed -n '/^## Starting a run/,/^### Filing a request/p' $r | grep -c 'factory drive')) depends=$(y $(sed -n '/^### What depends on Claude Code/,/^## Terms used/p' $r | grep -c 'claude -p')) built=$(y $(sed -n '/^\*\*Built\*\*/,/^\*\*Not built\*\*/p' $r | grep -c 'factory drive')) effort-gap=$(y $(grep -c 'none has an effort level' $r)) drive-row=$(y $(grep -cE '^\| `drive/' $r)) design=$(y $(grep -c 'factory drive' docs/design.md)) changelog=$(y $(grep -cE '^[0-9]+\. After issues? [^(]*#65' docs/changelog.md))")`
- THEN it prints exactly `starting=yes depends=yes built=yes effort-gap=no drive-row=yes design=yes changelog=yes`

### Requirement: The documents record the sibling-merge exception and the start-failure ruling
`docs/design.md`'s Spec drift paragraph SHALL name `main_after` as not drift and its routing rules SHALL name the `harness-bug: run start implementer` ruling; README's Unstick row SHALL name it, and its "Spec amendment and drift" bullet SHALL say a sibling's merge is not drift and SHALL no longer say the check has not yet fired; and `docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #85, numbered without a gap.

#### Scenario: The design doc, README and changelog record both changes
- WHEN `(y() { [ "$1" -gt 0 ] && echo yes || echo no; }; B=$(sed -n '/^- \*\*Spec amendment and drift\.\*\*/,/^- \*\*Re-plan after a re-spec\.\*\*/p' README.md); echo "design-drift=$(y $(grep '^\*\*Spec drift\.\*\*' docs/design.md | grep -c main_after)) design-ruling=$(y $(grep -c 'harness-bug: run start implementer' docs/design.md)) unstick=$(y $(grep '^| \*\*Unstick\*\*' README.md | grep -c 'harness-bug: run start implementer')) bullet-sibling=$(y $(echo "$B" | grep -c 'not drift')) bullet-stale=$(y $(echo "$B" | grep -c 'has not yet fired'))"; awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ".

### Requirement: The documents record the driver's exemption and its same-ticket guard
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #86, numbered without a gap. README's `factory drive` how-to SHALL no longer tell the operator to put the marker in front of the command, and SHALL say that the driver is exempt and what it refuses on the same ticket. The opening of README's "Where a human decides" SHALL say the driver is exempt. `docs/design.md`'s fence paragraph SHALL state the exemption and the same-ticket guard, and SHALL no longer say the driver meets the fence like any write.

#### Scenario: The documents describe the driver's exemption and its same-ticket guard
- WHEN `(y() { [ "$1" -gt 0 ] && echo yes || echo no; }; c() { tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' ' | grep -ci -- "$1"; }; r=README.md; D=$(sed -n '/^### Driving a ticket from a shell with `factory drive`/,/^Each role process/p' $r); H=$(sed -n '/^## Where a human decides/,/^```/p' $r); G=$(grep '^\*\*Only the dispatcher writes a live store during a run\.\*\*' docs/design.md); echo "changelog=$(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ".

- THEN it prints exactly `changelog=CONTIGUOUS entry=1 step=0 drive=yes,yes human=yes design=yes,yes,0`

### Requirement: The documents record factory stats
README SHALL list `stats` among the commands that are not writes, say under "Accepting a harness revision" that it skips the lock, describe it in a how-to subsection "Counting what each role catches and costs", in "What depends on Claude Code" and under **Built**; `docs/design.md` SHALL list it in the fence paragraph's read-only list, name it in the lock clause, and cite it in the model-per-role paragraph; `docs/principles.md` §4 SHALL name it as implemented and no longer say "1 BLOCKING finding in total"; and `docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issues #70 and #61, numbered without a gap.

#### Scenario: The documents record factory stats

### Requirement: The documents name the module that holds each moved gate command
`README.md` and `docs/principles.md` SHALL name `factory/gates.py`, not `factory/cli.py`, for
`ticket_join`, `merge_cmd`, `archive_cmd` and the `merge` guard, and those three functions MUST be
defined in `factory/gates.py`.

#### Scenario: The README and the principles name gates.py for the moved gate commands
- WHEN `echo "$(grep -c 'factory/gates.py. .ticket_join., .merge_cmd., .archive_cmd.' README.md) $(grep -c 'factory/cli.py. .ticket_join.' README.md) $(grep -c 'factory/gates.py.

- THEN it prints exactly `1 0 1 0 3`

### Requirement: The documents record that run start owns each role's model
`README.md`'s role-call paragraph under "The intake workflow, step by step" SHALL say that `run start` refuses a `--model` the instance does not name.

#### Scenario: The README describes the model check
- WHEN `(echo "readme=$(sed -n '/^### The intake workflow, step by step/,/sequenceDiagram/p' README.md | grep -c -- '--model' | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `readme=1`

### Requirement: The documents record the parallel suite and the waiting park reason
`docs/design.md`'s EMPTY-OUTPUT rule SHALL name the waiting park reason. `README.md` SHALL name pytest-xdist, and its Empty output entry SHALL give the waiting reason and no longer say it has not fired on a real ticket. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold entry 71 for issue #106, numbered without a gap.

#### Scenario: The design doc names the waiting park reason
- WHEN `(echo "design=$(grep '^- A role run that ends without writing its output is EMPTY-OUTPUT' docs/design.md | grep -c 'ended its turn waiting on a background command')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design=1`

#### Scenario: The README names pytest-xdist and the waiting reason
- WHEN `(B=$(awk '/^- \*\*Empty output\.\*\*/{f=1; print; next} f && /^(- \*\*|$|#)/{f=0} f' README.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "bullet=$(grep -c '^- \*\*Empty output\.\*\*' README.md) waiting=$(echo "$B" | grep -c 'ended its turn waiting on a background command') unfired=$(echo "$B" | grep -c 'has not yet fired') xdist=$(grep -c 'pytest-xdist' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `bullet=1 waiting=1 unfired=0 xdist=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records issue 106 as entry 71, without a numbering gap
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; E=$(grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #106 ' docs/changelog.md); printf '%s\n' "$E" | grep -c '^71\. '; printf '%s' "$E" | grep -oF -e 'pytest-xdist' -e 'ended its turn waiting on a background command' -e 'EMPTY-OUTPUT' -e 'stand-in' -e 'in-process' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`, then `5`

### Requirement: The maintained documents carry no whitespace errors
`README.md`, every file under `docs/` and `dev/`, and `.factory/context.md` MUST carry no whitespace error, checked over each file in full rather than over one change's diff.

#### Scenario: The maintained documents pass git's whitespace check in full
- WHEN `(E=$(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null); git diff --check $E HEAD -- README.md docs dev .factory/context.md; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The build documents under dev/ are frozen as history
`dev/build-harness.spec.md`, `dev/build-harness.plan.md` and `dev/P0-intake-skeleton.md` SHALL each carry, as line 3, a header that starts `> **Frozen as history.**`, followed by a blank line, and SHALL otherwise stay byte for byte as they were at `7231670`. `.factory/context.md` MUST NOT ask a change to keep any of them consistent, and SHALL call them frozen; README's `dev/` row SHALL say they are frozen as history.

#### Scenario: Each build document carries the header and is otherwise unchanged
- WHEN `(for f in dev/build-harness.spec.md dev/build-harness.plan.md dev/P0-intake-skeleton.md; do echo "$f header=$(sed -n 3p $f | grep -c '^> \*\*Frozen as history\.\*\* ') rest=$(sed '3,4d' $f | cmp -s - <(git show 7231670:$f) && echo same || echo changed)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `dev/build-harness.spec.md header=1 rest=same`, then `dev/build-harness.plan.md header=1 rest=same`, then `dev/P0-intake-skeleton.md header=1 rest=same`

#### Scenario: The briefing no longer asks a change to keep the build spec in step
- WHEN `(echo "buildspec=$(grep -c 'build-harness' .factory/context.md) frozen=$(grep -c 'frozen as history' .factory/context.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') readme=$(grep '^| .dev/. |' README.md | grep -c 'frozen as history')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `buildspec=0 frozen=1 readme=1`

### Requirement: README's claims about what has run match the stores
README MUST NOT say that the one-sub-ticket path, the driver, the per-run scratch directory, a gate command's path skip, the re-plan after a re-spec or the protected-path refusal at merge has not yet run, and MUST NOT say that a run with no output is recorded as killed. Its tripwire and sibling-tests entries SHALL still say they have not yet fired, and its per-role effort entry that neither target sets it. Its "Ground truth only above" rule SHALL ask each entry to say whether it has yet run on a real ticket, and line 3 of `docs/design.md` SHALL point to `docs/changelog.md` instead of carrying a date of its own.

#### Scenario: README no longer calls run features untried, and keeps the claims that are still true
- WHEN `(b() { awk -v h="$1" 'index($0,h)==1{f=1;print;next} f&&/^(- \*\*|$|#)/{f=0} f' README.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '; }; R=$(tr '\n' ' ' < README.md | tr -s ' '); echo "stale=$(printf '%s' "$R" | grep -oF -e 'one-sub-ticket path is tested' -e 'has not yet run a real ticket' -e 'remains the tested route' -e 'parked; this is tested' -e 'configuration uses it yet' -e 'recorded as killed' | grep -c .) replan=$(b '- **Re-plan after a re-spec.**' | grep -c 'not yet') paths=$(b '- **Protected paths at merge.**' | grep -c 'not yet') drive=$(b '- **The driver, ' | grep -c 'not yet') tripwire=$(b '- **Tripwire on live files.**' | grep -c 'has not yet fired') sibling=$(b '- **Sibling tests check.**' | grep -c 'has not yet fired') effort=$(b '- **Per-role effort' | grep -c 'Neither target sets it yet')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `stale=0 replan=0 paths=0 drive=0 tripwire=1 sibling=1 effort=1`

#### Scenario: The Built rule asks for run status, and the design doc's date line points to the changelog
- WHEN `(echo "rule=$(sed -n '/^- \*\*Ground truth only above/,/^- \*\*Update with the change/p' README.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' ' | grep -c 'its entry says whether it has yet run on a real ticket') date=$(sed -n 3p docs/design.md | grep -c 'docs/changelog.md') old=$(sed -n 3p docs/design.md | grep -c '^2026-09-30 · Daniel$')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `rule=1 date=1 old=0`

### Requirement: README describes each mechanism in one section
README SHALL describe the live-store fence under "Where a human decides", the driver under "Driving a ticket from a shell with `factory drive`", the final check's skip under "The build workflow, step by step", the store branch under "How the factory uses git", and other agent hosts only in `docs/design.md`. Elsewhere it SHALL give each a short entry with a pointer: the Built entries for the fence, the driver, the tripwire, the sibling-tests check, spec drift, empty output, protected paths at merge and `factory stats` SHALL each stay within a line budget and name the section or the `docs/design.md` paragraph that describes it, and "Not built" SHALL list nothing that "Where this can go" lists.

#### Scenario: Each Built entry is a short pointer, and each mechanism's detail has one home
`s` prints `pointer` when a Built entry is at most N lines and names its home, and `long` otherwise.
- WHEN `(b() { awk -v h="$1" 'index($0,h)==1{f=1;print;next} f&&/^(- \*\*|$|#)/{f=0} f' README.md; }; s() { b "$1" | awk -v n="$2" -v p="$3" '{t=t" "$0} END{gsub(/ +/," ",t); print ((NR>0 && NR<=n && index(t,p)) ? "pointer" : "long")}'; }; R=$(tr '\n' ' ' < README.md | tr -s ' '); echo "fence=$(s '- **Live-store fence.**' 3 'Where a human decides') driver=$(s '- **The driver, ' 4 'Driving a ticket from a shell') tripwire=$(s '- **Tripwire on live files.**' 4 'docs/design.md') sibling=$(s '- **Sibling tests check.**' 4 'docs/design.md') drift=$(s '- **Spec amendment and drift.**' 6 'docs/design.md') empty=$(s '- **Empty output.**' 6 'docs/design.md') paths=$(s '- **Protected paths at merge.**' 4 'Where a human decides') stats=$(s '- **Counting catch and cost' 3 'Counting what each role catches') host=$(sed -n '/^### Running on another agent host/,/^## /p' README.md | sed '1d;$d' | awk '{t=t" "$0} /./{n++} /^\|/{tab=1} END{print ((n<=6 && !tab && index(t,"docs/design.md")) ? "pointer" : "long")}') skip=$(printf '%s' "$R" | grep -o 'has not moved since' | grep -c .) store=$(printf '%s' "$R" | grep -o 'never moves the integration branch' | grep -c .) drivefence=$(sed -n '/^### Driving a ticket from a shell/,/^Each role process/p' README.md | tr '\n' ' ' | grep -c 'refused like any write') notbuilt=$(sed -n '/^\*\*Not built\*\*/,/^## Where this can go/p' README.md | grep -c '^- \*\*')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `fence=pointer driver=pointer tripwire=pointer sibling=pointer drift=pointer empty=pointer paths=pointer stats=pointer host=pointer skip=1 store=1 drivefence=0 notbuilt=0`

### Requirement: README defines each term once
README's "Terms used on this page" SHALL point to "Where it runs" for target, instance, runtime and store branch in one row instead of defining them again, and SHALL give protected path its own row; the merge gate row SHALL no longer define a protected path, and the **Record** row of "Where a human decides" SHALL no longer restate who reads the decision log.

#### Scenario: The glossary points to Where it runs and defines protected path once
- WHEN `(T=$(sed -n '/^## Terms used on this page/,/^## How a ticket moves/p' README.md); echo "rows=$(printf '%s\n' "$T" | grep -cE '^\| (target|instance|runtime|store branch) \|') pointer=$(printf '%s\n' "$T" | grep -c '^| target, instance, runtime, store branch |') protected=$(printf '%s\n' "$T" | grep -c '^| protected path |') merge=$(grep '^| merge gate |' README.md | grep -c 'protected_paths') record=$(grep '^| \*\*Record\*\*' README.md | grep -c 'receive')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `rows=0 pointer=1 protected=1 merge=0 record=0`

### Requirement: History lives in the changelog
README SHALL keep under "Related work and history" the issue references it carries today, and SHALL no longer carry the history this change moves: the 2026-10-04 overlap count, the double count `factory/cost.py` once made, the store moves, the page's own origin story and the regeneration pass's past catches. `docs/design.md`'s model-per-role paragraph SHALL point to changelog entry 70 for the first `factory stats` figures instead of repeating them. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #101 recording the move, numbered without a gap.

#### Scenario: README keeps its issue references and drops the moved history, and the changelog records the move
- WHEN `(R=$(tr '\n' ' ' < README.md | tr -s ' '); X=$(sed -n '/^## Related work and history/,/^## Maintaining this page/p' README.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); M=$(grep '^\*\*Model per role, starting point\.\*\*' docs/design.md); E=$(grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #101 ' docs/changelog.md); echo "history=$(printf '%s' "$R" | grep -oF -e '41 and 11 overlapping' -e 'used to count most calls about twice' -e 'First written 2026-10-03' -e 'today this caught' -e 'were moved onto it' | grep -c .) refs=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -oE '#[0-9]+' | sort -u | grep -xcE '#(16|17|18|19|20|21|22|23|24|28|35|42|46|47|53|55|61|65|70)') figures=$(printf '%s' "$M" | grep -c '94,860,442') pointer=$(printf '%s' "$M" | grep -c 'changelog entry 70') entries=$(printf '%s\n' "$E" | grep -c .) terms=$(printf '%s' "$E" | grep -oF -e frozen -e build-harness.spec.md -e context.md -e '41 and 11' -e harness-docs -e 'not yet' | sort -u | grep -c .)"; awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md)`
- THEN it prints exactly `history=0 refs=19 figures=0 pointer=1 entries=1 terms=6`, then `CONTIGUOUS`

### Requirement: README stays within its line budget
`README.md` SHALL be at most 1,225 lines long; a later change that needs more room raises this bound in its own spec, where the operator approves it at the gate.

#### Scenario: README is at most 1,225 lines
- WHEN `(echo "readme=$(wc -l < README.md | awk '{print ($1 <= 1225 ? "within" : "over")}')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `readme=within`

### Requirement: docs/standards.md holds the operator's writing and design standards
`docs/standards.md` SHALL open with a `# ` title line, and the text after that line SHALL be the operator's approved standards text, whose SHA-256 is `010d1300876f602b35efc641a1b7effbd149035695e3161e6606d1718f24d26e`; a change to that text modifies this requirement in its own spec.

#### Scenario: The standards file holds the approved text
- WHEN `(f=docs/standards.md; echo "title=$(head -1 $f 2>/dev/null | grep -c '^# ') body=$(sed 1d $f 2>/dev/null | LC_ALL=C shasum -a 256 | cut -c1-64)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `title=1 body=010d1300876f602b35efc641a1b7effbd149035695e3161e6606d1718f24d26e`

### Requirement: README points to docs/standards.md
README's "Where things live" table SHALL have exactly one row naming `docs/standards.md`.

#### Scenario: Where things live names the standards file
- WHEN `(echo "row=$(sed -n '/^## Where things live/,/^## Related work and history/p' README.md | grep '^| ' | grep -c 'docs/standards.md')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `row=1`

### Requirement: No role prompt reads docs/standards.md
No file under `docs/prompts/`, `factory/` or `agents/`, and not `docs/writing.md`, SHALL name `docs/standards.md`, so adding it changes no role's behaviour; a spec that changes prompts may modify this requirement.

#### Scenario: Nothing a role reads names the standards file
- WHEN `(echo "readers=$(grep -rlF 'standards.md' docs/prompts docs/writing.md factory agents | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `readers=0`

### Requirement: The north star names its target without the private product
`docs/north-star.md` SHALL describe the factory's current target as "a port of the Nanobot chat bot" in its one sentence on whom the factory serves.

#### Scenario: The north-star sentence names a port of the Nanobot chat bot
- WHEN `(echo "line=$(grep -cxF 'The factory serves its own development (spec-factory) and its targets (today, a port of the Nanobot chat bot).' docs/north-star.md) serves=$(grep -c '^The factory serves its own development' docs/north-star.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `line=1 serves=1`

### Requirement: The documents record the standards file
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold exactly one entry opening `<n>. After issue #110 `, naming `docs/standards.md`, `docs/writing.md` and `docs/north-star.md`, and its entries SHALL stay numbered without a gap.

#### Scenario: The changelog records issue 110 in one entry without a numbering gap
- WHEN `(E=$(grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #110 ' docs/changelog.md); echo "entries=$(printf '%s\n' "$E" | grep -c .) terms=$(printf '%s' "$E" | grep -oF -e 'docs/standards.md' -e 'docs/north-star.md' -e 'docs/writing.md' | sort -u | grep -c .)"; awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md)`
- THEN it prints exactly `entries=1 terms=3`, then `CONTIGUOUS`

### Requirement: The documents record the template fix and init's report of a differing agent copy
`README.md`'s `.claude/agents/factory-*.md` row SHALL say that init reports a copy that differs from its template, and step 1 of "Adopting the factory in a repo" SHALL name `stale_agents`. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #108, numbered without a gap, that names `frontmatter`, `stale_agents` and `Nanobot`. README MUST stay within its 1,225-line budget, and both documents MUST carry no whitespace error.

#### Scenario: README describes init's report of a differing agent copy
- WHEN `(echo "row=$(grep '^| .\.claude/agents/factory-\*\.md. |' README.md | grep -c 'differs from its template') step=$(sed -n '/^### Adopting the factory in a repo/,/^2\. /p' README.md | tr '\n' ' ' | grep -c 'stale_agents') missing=$(grep '^| .\.claude/agents/factory-\*\.md. |' README.md | grep -c 'when they are missing')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `row=1 step=1 missing=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records issue 108 in one entry without a numbering gap
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; E=$(grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #108 ' docs/changelog.md); printf '%s\n' "$E" | grep -c .; printf '%s' "$E" | grep -oF -e frontmatter -e stale_agents -e Nanobot | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`, then `3`

#### Scenario: README stays within its line budget and both documents pass the whitespace check
- WHEN `(E=$(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null); echo "readme=$(wc -l < README.md | awk '{print ($1 <= 1225 ? "within" : "over")}')"; git diff --check $E HEAD -- README.md docs/changelog.md >/dev/null; echo "check=$?")`
- THEN it prints exactly `readme=within`, then `check=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the launch copy and the route back to checks
`README.md`'s "Starting a run" SHALL tell the operator to launch the copy `factory launch-script` writes. Its "Where a human decides" SHALL list `launch-script` among the commands that are not writes, and its **Unstick** row SHALL name `resolve --to checks`. `docs/design.md` SHALL list `launch-script` in the live-store fence's read-only list and describe the `--to checks` route. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry opening `After issue #109`, naming #112, `launch-script` and `--to checks`, numbered without a gap. README SHALL stay within its 1,225-line budget, and the maintained documents SHALL carry no whitespace error.

#### Scenario: The README, the design doc and the changelog describe the launch copy and the route back to checks
Run from the repository root of the checkout under test.
- WHEN `(y() { [ "$1" -gt 0 ] && echo yes || echo no; }; R=$(tr '\n' ' ' < README.md | tr -s ' '); echo "start=$(y $(sed -n '/^## Starting a run/,/^### Driving a ticket/p' README.md | grep -c 'factory launch-script')) unstick=$(y $(grep '^| \*\*Unstick\*\*' README.md | grep -c -- '--to checks')) writes=$(y $(printf '%s' "$R" | grep -o 'A write is any command except [^;]*;' | grep -c 'launch-script')) list=$(printf '%s' "$R" | grep -o 'A write is any command except [^;]*;' | grep -c .) fence=$(y $(grep '^\*\*Only the dispatcher writes a live store' docs/design.md | grep -c 'launch-script')) route=$(y $(grep -c -- '--to checks' docs/design.md)) readme=$(wc -l < README.md | awk '{print ($1 <= 1225 ? "within" : "over")}')"; awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; E=$(grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #109 ' docs/changelog.md); echo "entries=$(printf '%s\n' "$E" | grep -c .) terms=$(printf '%s' "$E" | grep -oF -e '#112' -e 'launch-script' -e '--to checks' | sort -u | grep -c .)"; E0=$(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null); git diff --check $E0 HEAD -- README.md docs dev .factory/context.md; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints exactly `start=yes unstick=yes writes=yes list=1 fence=yes route=yes readme=within`, `CONTIGUOUS`, `entries=1 terms=3`, `exit=0`, one per line

### Requirement: README draws how a spec changes and feeds later tickets
`README.md`'s "How a ticket moves" SHALL hold a subsection "How a spec changes and feeds later tickets", placed before "Ticket states", whose one Mermaid diagram uses the section's three colour classes. Its edges SHALL draw `request-changes`, `approve-spec --edit`, `planned_from`, the drift check, `spec amend` with `resolve --ruling`, `resolve --to spec-gate`, `resolve --replan`, `archive` writing current truth and `decisions.md`, and `decision add` writing the log. A subgraph titled "a later ticket" SHALL hold that ticket's triage, spec writer, critic and planner.

#### Scenario: The spec's-life diagram draws every route after the critic
- WHEN `(D=$(awk '/^### How a spec changes and feeds later tickets$/{s=1;next} s&&/^#/{s=0} s&&/^[`][`][`]mermaid$/{f=1;next} f&&/^[`][`][`]$/{f=0;s=0} f' README.md); E=$(printf '%s\n' "$D" | grep -E -- '-->|\.->'); y() { printf '%s\n' "$E" | grep -qF -- "$1" && echo yes || echo no; }; L=$(printf '%s\n' "$D" | sed -n '/^ *subgraph .*"a later ticket"/,/^ *end$/p'); echo "classes=$(printf '%s\n' "$D" | grep -cE '^ *classDef (human|orch|store) ') request=$(y request-changes) edit=$(y '--edit') amend=$(y 'spec amend') respec=$(y '--to spec-gate') replan=$(y '--replan') ruling=$(y '--ruling') planned=$(y planned_from) drift=$(y drift) truth=$(y 'current truth') log=$(y decisions.md) writers=$(y 'decision add') later=$(printf '%s\n' "$L" | grep -oE 'Triage|Spec writer|critic|Planner' | sort -u | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `classes=3 request=yes edit=yes amend=yes respec=yes replan=yes ruling=yes planned=yes drift=yes truth=yes log=yes writers=yes later=4`

### Requirement: The clerk node says it exists only on the Workflow-script path
The clerk node of the first diagram in "How a ticket moves" SHALL say that the clerk exists only on the Workflow-script path, that the launch copy carries the settings it does not relay, and that `factory drive` needs no clerk.

#### Scenario: The clerk node names the Workflow-script path, the launch copy and factory drive
- WHEN `(C=$(sed -n '/^## How a ticket moves/,/^### /p' README.md | grep 'clerk agent'); echo "clerk=$(printf '%s\n' "$C" | grep -c .) workflow=$(printf '%s' "$C" | grep -c 'Workflow-script path only') launch=$(printf '%s' "$C" | grep -c 'launch copy') drive=$(printf '%s' "$C" | grep -c 'factory drive')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `clerk=1 workflow=1 launch=1 drive=1`

### Requirement: The diagrams of How a ticket moves are well formed
"How a ticket moves" SHALL hold two Mermaid blocks. Each SHALL open with `flowchart LR` and close its fence, and on every line its quotes, square brackets, parentheses and braces SHALL balance once quoted labels are set aside. This is a structural check, not a parse.

#### Scenario: Both diagrams of How a ticket moves have balanced quotes and brackets
- WHEN `(awk '/^## How a ticket moves/{s=1} /^### Ticket states/{s=0} !s{next} /^[`][`][`]mermaid$/{b++;f=1;n=0;next} f&&/^[`][`][`]$/{f=0;next} !f{next} {n++; l=$0; gsub(/"[^"]*"/,"Q",l); if (n==1 && l!="flowchart LR") bad++; if (index(l,"\"")) bad++; o=l; c1=gsub(/\[/,"",o); c2=gsub(/\]/,"",o); c3=gsub(/\(/,"",o); c4=gsub(/\)/,"",o); c5=gsub(/\{/,"",o); c6=gsub(/\}/,"",o); if (c1!=c2||c3!=c4||c5!=c6) bad++} END{if (f) bad++; print "blocks=" b+0 " bad=" bad+0}' README.md)`
- THEN it prints exactly `blocks=2 bad=0`

### Requirement: The regeneration table names the modules the spec's-life diagram is drawn from
The "How a ticket moves" row of README's "Regenerating this page from scratch" SHALL name `factory/human.py`, `factory/subtickets.py`, `factory/drift.py`, `factory/specstore.py` and `factory/compose.py`.

#### Scenario: The How a ticket moves row names the five modules
- WHEN `(R=$(grep '^| How a ticket moves |' README.md); echo "row=$(printf '%s\n' "$R" | grep -c .) names=$(printf '%s' "$R" | grep -oF -e factory/human.py -e factory/subtickets.py -e factory/drift.py -e factory/specstore.py -e factory/compose.py | sort -u | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `row=1 names=5`

### Requirement: The documents record the footer rule, the unreadable agent copy and the --accept-harness refusal
README's "Accepting a harness revision" SHALL say, in one sentence, that `init`, `paths` and `stats` refuse `--accept-harness`. Step 2 of "Upgrading the runtime" SHALL name `--accept-harness <sha> config`. "Counting what each role catches and costs" SHALL say that `stats` refuses `--accept-harness`. The `.claude/agents/factory-*.md` row SHALL say that init reports a copy it cannot read. `docs/design.md`'s ESCALATIONS bullet SHALL name the dropped `Generated with [Claude Code]` footer, and its `harness.lock` clause SHALL say, in one sentence, that `init`, `paths` and `stats` refuse `--accept-harness`. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry naming #88, #113, #114 and #115, numbered without a gap.

#### Scenario: README says which commands refuse the flag, how to accept a revision, and that init reports an unreadable copy
- WHEN `(S=$(sed -n '/^### Accepting a harness revision/,/^### Upgrading the runtime/p' README.md); U=$(sed -n '/^### Upgrading the runtime/,/^### Installing the harness/p' README.md | grep '^2\. '); C=$(sed -n '/^### Counting what each role catches and costs/,/^```/p' README.md); echo "accepting=$(printf '%s' "$S" | python3 -c 'import re, sys; print(sum(1 for s in re.split(r"\.\s", sys.stdin.read()) if all(w in s for w in ("init", "paths", "stats", "--accept-harness")) and "refuse" in s))') upgrade=$(printf '%s' "$U" | grep -c -- '--accept-harness <sha> config') stats=$(printf '%s' "$C" | tr '\n' ' ' | grep -c 'refuses .--accept-harness.') row=$(grep '^| .\.claude/agents/factory-\*\.md. |' README.md | grep -c 'cannot read')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `accepting=1 upgrade=1 stats=1 row=1`

#### Scenario: The design doc states the footer rule and the refusal in the lock clause
- WHEN `(echo "footer=$(grep '^- A non-empty ESCALATIONS line' docs/design.md | grep -cF 'Generated with [Claude Code]') lock=$(grep '^\*\*Role-context block\.\*\*' docs/design.md | python3 -c 'import re, sys; print(sum(1 for s in re.split(r"\.\s", sys.stdin.read()) if all(w in s for w in ("init", "paths", "stats", "--accept-harness")) and "refuse" in s))')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `footer=1 lock=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records the four issues in one entry without a numbering gap
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; E=$(grep -E '^[0-9]+\. ' docs/changelog.md | grep -F '#88' | grep -F '#113' | grep -F '#114' | grep -F '#115'); printf '%s\n' "$E" | grep -c .; printf '%s' "$E" | grep -oF -e 'Generated with' -e stale_agents -e '--accept-harness' -e '/bin/sh' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`, then `4`

### Requirement: The north star says how the factory's work is measured and reviewed
`docs/north-star.md` SHALL hold, as its second `## ` section, "How we know it is working". That section SHALL name the primary metric, its constraint, cost as the second measure, operator decisions and interventions standing in for hours of operator attention, spec-factory's merges reported on a line of their own, the scorecard's five numbers as table rows, the plain-session baseline, the upstream benchmark, change failure rate, the baseline review `docs/reviews/2026-10-19.md`, and a review every two weeks from `docs/reviews/TEMPLATE.md` that rewrites `STATUS.md`, the first from the template on 2026-11-02. The file MUST keep its four success measures and its sentence on whom the factory serves.

#### Scenario: The north star holds the measurement section and keeps its measures and target sentence
- WHEN `(N=docs/north-star.md; X=$(awk '/^## How we know it is working$/{f=1;next} f&&/^## /{f=0} f' $N); S=$(printf '%s' "$X" | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "heading=$(grep -cx '## How we know it is working' $N) second=$(grep '^## ' $N | sed -n 2p | grep -cx '## How we know it is working') terms=$(printf '%s' "$S" | grep -oF -e 'correct target changes per hour of operator attention' -e 'escaped defects do not rise' -e 'tokens and wall time per change' -e 'in place of hours of operator attention' -e 'on a line of their own' -e 'plain-session baseline' -e 'upstream benchmark' -e 'change failure rate' -e 'every two weeks' -e 'docs/reviews/TEMPLATE.md' -e 'docs/reviews/2026-10-19.md' -e 'STATUS.md' -e '2026-11-02' | sort -u | grep -c .) rows=$(printf '%s\n' "$X" | grep -cE '^\| (Target changes merged|Escapes|Operator decisions and interventions per change|Tokens and wall time per change|Lead time) \|') measures=$(sed -n '/^Success is measured as:$/,/^$/p' $N | grep -c '^- ') serves=$(grep -cxF 'The factory serves its own development (spec-factory) and its targets (today, a port of the Nanobot chat bot).' $N)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `heading=1 second=1 terms=13 rows=5 measures=4 serves=1`

### Requirement: The north star holds the rule for factory work
`docs/north-star.md`'s "How it decides where effort goes" SHALL introduce four working rules, and one of them SHALL be "Factory work serves a target or a number". That rule SHALL admit a factory ticket only if it fixes a defect that hit a target ticket, or names the scorecard number it moves and re-measures that number after it ships, and SHALL say that the operator applies it at the spec gate.

#### Scenario: The north star's working rules include the rule for factory work
- WHEN `(N=docs/north-star.md; B=$(sed -n '/^## How it decides where effort goes$/,/^## Where it is heading$/p' $N | awk '/^- \*\*Factory work serves a target or a number\.\*\*/{f=1;print;next} f&&/^(- \*\*|$|#)/{f=0} f' | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "rule=$(printf '%s' "$B" | grep -c 'Factory work serves') terms=$(printf '%s' "$B" | grep -oF -e 'fixes a defect that hit a target ticket' -e 'names the scorecard number it moves' -e 're-measures that number after it ships' -e 'spec gate' | sort -u | grep -c .) four=$(grep -cx 'And four working rules that follow from them:' $N) three=$(grep -cx 'And three working rules that follow from them:' $N)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `rule=1 terms=4 four=1 three=0`

### Requirement: README shows the north star on its first screen
`README.md` SHALL hold one paragraph opening `**North star.**`, placed before "What problem it solves", that states the primary metric per hour of operator attention and names `docs/north-star.md`, `STATUS.md` and `docs/reviews/`. README MUST stay within its 1,225-line budget.

#### Scenario: README opens with the north-star paragraph and stays within its budget
- WHEN `(H=$(grep -n '^## What problem it solves$' README.md | cut -d: -f1); B=$(awk -v h="$H" 'NR>=h{exit} /^\*\*North star\.\*\*/{f=1} f&&/^$/{f=0} f' README.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "block=$(grep -c '^\*\*North star\.\*\*' README.md) top=$(printf '%s' "$B" | grep -c '^\*\*North star\.\*\*') metric=$(printf '%s' "$B" | grep -c 'per hour of operator attention') links=$(printf '%s' "$B" | grep -oF -e 'docs/north-star.md' -e 'STATUS.md' -e 'docs/reviews/' | sort -u | grep -c .) readme=$(wc -l < README.md | awk '{print ($1 <= 1225 ? "within" : "over")}')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `block=1 top=1 metric=1 links=3 readme=within`

### Requirement: README's filing steps state the rule for factory work
README's "Filing a request from an issue tracker" SHALL say that a request to change the factory itself goes ahead only if it fixes a defect that hit a ticket of the product the factory builds, or names the scorecard number it moves and re-measures it after it ships. It SHALL also say that the operator applies the rule at the spec gate.

#### Scenario: The filing section states the rule for factory work
- WHEN `(F=$(sed -n '/^### Filing a request from an issue tracker$/,/^### Running many tickets/p' README.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "terms=$(printf '%s' "$F" | grep -oF -e 'change the factory itself goes ahead only if' -e 'fixes a defect that hit a ticket of the product' -e 'names the scorecard number it moves' -e 're-measures it after it ships' -e 'spec gate' | sort -u | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `terms=5`

### Requirement: README's Where things live names the new files
README's "Where things live" table SHALL have exactly one row naming `STATUS.md`, one naming `docs/reviews/` and one naming `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

#### Scenario: Where things live has a row for each new file
- WHEN `(Q=$(printf '\140'); W=$(sed -n '/^## Where things live$/,/^## Related work and history$/p' README.md | grep '^| '); echo "status=$(printf '%s\n' "$W" | grep -c "${Q}STATUS.md${Q}") reviews=$(printf '%s\n' "$W" | grep -c "${Q}docs/reviews/${Q}") contributing=$(printf '%s\n' "$W" | grep -c "${Q}CONTRIBUTING.md${Q}")")`
- THEN it prints exactly `status=1 reviews=1 contributing=1`

### Requirement: CONTRIBUTING.md says how work is proposed and chosen
`CONTRIBUTING.md` SHALL exist at the repository root. It SHALL give the steps Issue, Factory ticket and Spec gate as a numbered list in that order, state the rule for factory work, link `docs/north-star.md`, and carry no whitespace error.

#### Scenario: CONTRIBUTING.md gives the three steps and the rule, and links the north star
- WHEN `(C=CONTRIBUTING.md; [ -f $C ] || { echo "missing=$C"; exit 0; }; T=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $C | tr -s ' '); E=$(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null); echo "steps=$(grep -E '^[0-9]+\. \*\*' $C | sed -E 's/^[0-9]+\. \*\*([^*]*)\*\*.*/\1/' | tr '\n' '|') rule=$(printf '%s' "$T" | grep -oF -e 'fixes a defect that hit a target ticket' -e 'names the scorecard number it moves' -e 're-measures that number after it ships' -e 'spec gate' | sort -u | grep -c .) northstar=$(grep -c '](docs/north-star.md)' $C | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') ws=$(git diff --check $E HEAD -- $C >/dev/null && echo clean || echo errors)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `steps=Issue.|Factory ticket.|Spec gate.| rule=4 northstar=1 ws=clean`

### Requirement: STATUS.md holds the north star, the baseline's figures, the focus, the queue and the experiments
`STATUS.md` SHALL exist at the repository root, at most 60 lines long. It SHALL open its body with the north star in one line, and hold the sections Scorecard, Current focus, Top of the queue, Open experiments and Links, in that order. It SHALL link `docs/north-star.md`, the latest review `docs/reviews/2026-10-19.md`, the folder `docs/reviews/`, the repository's issues and the store branch, and carry no whitespace error. Its Scorecard section SHALL link the baseline review, say its figures were counted by hand, and name `factory stats`. Its Scorecard table SHALL hold six rows with a column for the Nanobot port and one for spec-factory. Each cell MUST appear as a cell of that instance's table in `docs/reviews/2026-10-19.md`, and each figure in the section's prose MUST appear in that review.

#### Scenario: STATUS.md has its sections and links, and quotes only the baseline review's figures
- WHEN `(F=STATUS.md; R=docs/reviews/2026-10-19.md; [ -f $F ] || { echo "missing=$F"; exit 0; }; E=$(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null); C=$(sed -n '/^## Scorecard$/,/^## /p' $F | sed '1d;$d'); P=$(sed -n '/^## The Nanobot port$/,/^## Spec-factory/p' $R 2>/dev/null); G=$(sed -n '/^## Spec-factory/,/^## Escapes$/p' $R 2>/dev/null); cells=$(printf '%s\n' "$C" | grep -E '^\| [A-Z]' | sed 1d | while IFS='|' read -r _ _ a b _; do a=$(printf '%s' "$a" | sed 's/^ *//; s/ *$//'); b=$(printf '%s' "$b" | sed 's/^ *//; s/ *$//'); printf '%s\n' "$P" | grep -qF -e "| $a |" -e "| $a (" || echo x; printf '%s\n' "$G" | grep -qF -e "| $b |" -e "| $b (" || echo x; done | grep -c x); U=0; for t in $(printf '%s\n' "$C" | grep -v '^|' | sed -E 's/\[[^]]*\]\([^)]*\)//g; s/#[0-9]+//g; s/[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}//g' | grep -oE '[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?'); do grep -qE "(^|[^0-9.])$(printf '%s' "$t" | sed 's/\./\\./')([^0-9.]|\$)" $R 2>/dev/null || U=$((U+1)); done; echo "lines=$(wc -l < $F | awk '{print ($1 <= 60 ?

- THEN it prints exactly `lines=within sections=## Scorecard|## Current focus|## Top of the queue|## Open experiments|## Links| northstar=1 links=5 scorecard=3 rows=6 cells_unsourced=0 prose_unsourced=0 ws=clean`

### Requirement: The review template holds the six sections a review fills in
`docs/reviews/TEMPLATE.md` SHALL hold six numbered `## ` sections in this order:
1. the scorecard against the last review, taken from `factory stats`, naming the baseline review as the one counted by hand;
2. what was worked on;
3. what was chosen not to do, linking `docs/decided-against.md`;
4. successes and failures;
5. experiments and side work, naming the `experiment` label;
6. decisions and the new queue order.

It SHALL also link `STATUS.md`.

#### Scenario: The review template's sections are the six the request lists, in order
- WHEN `(F=docs/reviews/TEMPLATE.md; [ -f $F ] || { echo "missing=$F"; exit 0; }; Q=$(printf '\140'); grep '^## ' $F; y() { [ "$1" -gt 0 ] && echo yes || echo no; }; echo "decided=$(y $(sed -n '/^## 3\. /,/^## 4\. /p' $F | grep -c '](../decided-against.md)')) experiment=$(y $(sed -n '/^## 5\. /,/^## 6\. /p' $F | grep -c "${Q}experiment${Q}")) stats=$(y $(sed -n '/^## 1\. /,/^## 2\. /p' $F | grep -c 'factory stats')) baseline=$(y $(sed -n '/^## 1\. /,/^## 2\. /p' $F | grep -c '](2026-10-19.md)')) status=$(y $(grep -c '](../../STATUS.md)' $F))")`
- THEN it prints exactly `## 1. Scorecard against the last review`, `## 2. What we worked on`, `## 3. What we chose not to do`, `## 4. Successes and failures`, `## 5. Experiments and side work`, `## 6. Decisions and the new queue order`, `decided=yes experiment=yes stats=yes baseline=yes status=yes`, one per line

### Requirement: The baseline review is the operator's baseline, verbatim
`docs/reviews/2026-10-19.md` SHALL exist. Its first line SHALL be `# Review 2026-10-19: baseline scorecard, 2026-10-03 to 2026-10-19`. Every line after the first SHALL be byte for byte the operator's baseline after its own title line, as recorded on the store branch at `02e403f` in `requests/T-0055.md`. The file SHALL carry no whitespace error.

#### Scenario: The baseline review matches the operator's text after its first line
- WHEN `(F=docs/reviews/2026-10-19.md; [ -f $F ] || { echo "missing=$F"; exit 0; }; E=$(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null); a=$(sed 1d $F | git hash-object --stdin); b=$(git show 02e403f:requests/T-0055.md | sed -n '/^--- baseline begins ---$/,/^--- baseline ends ---$/p' | sed '1,2d;$d' | git hash-object --stdin); echo "head=$(head -1 $F)"; echo "body=$([ "$a" = "$b" ] && echo verbatim || echo differs) ws=$(git diff --check $E HEAD -- $F >/dev/null && echo clean || echo errors)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `head=# Review 2026-10-19: baseline scorecard, 2026-10-03 to 2026-10-19`, then `body=verbatim ws=clean`

### Requirement: The new pages' relative links resolve
Every relative Markdown link in `STATUS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/reviews/TEMPLATE.md` SHALL name a path that exists, resolved from the linking file's directory, and each of the three SHALL hold at least one such link.

#### Scenario: No relative link in the three new pages is broken
- WHEN `(for f in STATUS.md CONTRIBUTING.md docs/reviews/TEMPLATE.md; do [ -f "$f" ] || { echo "$f missing"; continue; }; d=$(dirname "$f"); n=0; bad=0; for l in $(grep -oE '\]\([^)#]+\)' "$f" | sed -E 's/^\]\(//; s/\)$//' | grep -v '^[a-z]*:'); do n=$((n+1)); [ -e "$d/$l" ] || bad=$((bad+1)); done; echo "$f relative=$([ $n -gt 0 ] && echo some || echo none) broken=$bad"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `STATUS.md relative=some broken=0`, `CONTRIBUTING.md relative=some broken=0`, `docs/reviews/TEMPLATE.md relative=some broken=0`, one per line

### Requirement: The changelog records issue 116
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold exactly one entry opening `<n>. After issue #116 `. The entry SHALL name `docs/north-star.md`, `STATUS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/reviews/TEMPLATE.md`, `docs/reviews/2026-10-19.md`, the primary metric and the spec gate. The entries SHALL stay numbered without a gap, and the changelog SHALL end with its `Declined:` line.

#### Scenario: The changelog records issue 116 in one entry without a numbering gap
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; E=$(grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #116 ' docs/changelog.md); echo "entries=$(printf '%s\n' "$E" | grep -c .) terms=$(printf '%s' "$E" | grep -oF -e 'docs/north-star.md' -e 'STATUS.md' -e 'CONTRIBUTING.md' -e 'docs/reviews/TEMPLATE.md' -e 'docs/reviews/2026-10-19.md' -e 'per hour of operator attention' -e 'spec gate' | sort -u | grep -c .) last=$(tail -1 docs/changelog.md | grep -c '^Declined:')")`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `entries=1 terms=7 last=1`

### Requirement: The documents record the scorecard, escape and intervention records, and workflow token records
README SHALL describe `factory stats --scorecard` and `target_is_factory` in "Counting what each role catches and costs", with the run token record that `run finish --transcripts` writes in place of the claim that only driver runs carry a cost record; SHALL give `factory escape add` and `factory intervention add` their rows in "Where a human decides", the **Escape** row saying the store keeps only the link's SHA-256 hash; SHALL list the transcript record among the six pieces in "What depends on Claude Code"; and SHALL give the three a short Built entry that points to that subsection and says they have not yet run on a real store; `factory/instance.template.yaml` SHALL document `target_is_factory`.

#### Scenario: README and the instance template describe the scorecard, the two records and the token record
- WHEN `(r=README.md; y() { [ "$1" -gt 0 ] && echo yes || echo no; }; C=$(sed -n '/^### Counting what each role catches and costs/,/^## /p' $r); H=$(sed -n '/^## Where a human decides/,/^### What you read at each stop/p' $r); D=$(sed -n '/^### What depends on Claude Code/,/^## Terms used/p' $r); echo "scorecard=$(y $(printf '%s\n' "$C" | grep -c -- '--scorecard')) setting=$(y $(printf '%s\n' "$C" | grep -c 'target_is_factory')) escape=$(y $(printf '%s\n' "$H" | grep '^| \*\*Escape\*\* |' | grep -c 'factory escape add')) hash=$(y $(printf '%s\n' "$H" | grep '^| \*\*Escape\*\* |' | grep -c 'SHA-256')) intervene=$(y $(printf '%s\n' "$H" | grep '^| \*\*Intervene\*\* |' | grep -c 'factory intervention add')) record=$(y $(printf '%s\n' "$C" | tr '\n' ' ' | grep -c 'run finish --transcripts')) old=$(y $(grep -c 'Any other run has its tokens only in the transcript' $r)) depends=$(y $(printf '%s\n' "$D" | grep '^| ' | grep -c 'run finish --transcripts')) pieces=$(y $(printf '%s\n' "$D" | grep -c 'Six pieces assume Claude Code')) template=$(y $(grep -c 'target_is_factory' factory/instance.template.yaml))"; awk -v h='- **The scorecard, escapes and workflow token records.**' 'index($0,h)==1{f=1;print;next} f&&/^(- \*\*|$|#)/{f=0} f' $r | awk '{t=t" "$0} END{gsub(/ +/," ",t); print ((NR>0 && NR<=3 && index(t,"Counting what each role catches") && index(t,"Not yet run on a real store")) ?

- THEN it prints exactly `scorecard=yes setting=yes escape=yes hash=yes intervene=yes record=yes old=no depends=yes pieces=yes template=yes`, then `built=pointer`

## Current truth: harness-suite

# harness-suite

## Requirements

### Requirement: The harness suite runs mid-edit without loosening the lock
The harness's own test suite SHALL pass in a checkout that has an uncommitted edit under a harness path, and a store command on an instance's own store run from such a checkout MUST still be refused.

#### Scenario: The harness suite passes with an uncommitted harness edit
The command gives pytest its own temporary directory under `/tmp`, because four existing tests need one outside every repository and instance. Run it as written, whatever `TMPDIR` the caller has set; it removes that directory when it ends.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && P=$(mktemp -d /tmp/t0023-suite.XXXXXX) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && echo '# uncommitted edit' >> $T/c/factory/status.py && cd $T/c && TMPDIR=$P .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | tail -1; rm -rf "$P")`
- THEN it prints one line reporting a number of passed tests and no `failed` or `error`

#### Scenario: The uncommitted-edit refusal still holds on an instance's own store
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && echo '# uncommitted edit' >> $T/c/factory/status.py && git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $T/c/bin/factory init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && $T/c/bin/factory config >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$?"; head -1 $T/err | grep -o 'has uncommitted changes:$')`
- THEN it prints `exit=2`, then `has uncommitted changes:`

### Requirement: Test files share code only through helper modules
No file of the harness suite SHALL import from another test file; code that more than one test file uses MUST live in a non-test helper module.

#### Scenario: No test file imports from another test file
- WHEN `.venv/bin/python -c 'import ast,pathlib; bad=[f"{p.name}:{n.lineno}" for p in sorted(pathlib.Path("tests/factory").glob("*.py")) for n in ast.walk(ast.parse(p.read_text())) if (isinstance(n,ast.ImportFrom) and (any(s.startswith("test_") for s in (n.module or "").split(".")) or any(a.name.startswith("test_") for a in n.names))) or (isinstance(n,ast.Import) and any(s.startswith("test_") for a in n.names for s in a.name.split(".")))]; print(f"cross-test imports: {len(bad)}", *bad)'`
- THEN it prints `cross-test imports: 0`

### Requirement: Each shared test helper is written once
The repository and entry-point constants, the call wrapper, the JSON reader, the ticket reader, the empty-repository setup and the approved-parent setup SHALL each be defined in exactly one place in the harness suite, and this stays a standing guard: a later test file that needs one of them imports it.

#### Scenario: The shared constants and wrappers are defined once
- WHEN `.venv/bin/python -c 'import ast,pathlib,collections; c=collections.Counter(t.id if isinstance(n,ast.Assign) else n.name for p in pathlib.Path("tests/factory").glob("*.py") for n in ast.parse(p.read_text()).body for t in (n.targets if isinstance(n,ast.Assign) else [n]) if isinstance(t,(ast.Name,ast.FunctionDef))); print(*(f"{k}={c[k]}" for k in ("REPO","BIN","run","js","ticket","git_repo","approved_parent")))'`
- THEN it prints `REPO=1 BIN=1 run=1 js=1 ticket=1 git_repo=1 approved_parent=1`

#### Scenario: The approved-parent and empty-repository setups are written once
- WHEN `.venv/bin/python -c 'import pathlib; L={p:p.read_text().splitlines() for p in sorted(pathlib.Path("tests/factory").glob("*.py"))}; ap=[f"{p.name}:{i+1}" for p,l in L.items() for i in range(1,len(l)-3) if "ready-for-spec-writer" in l[i-1] and "\"spec\", \"add\"" in l[i] and "\"spec:init\"" in l[i+1] and "awaiting-spec-gate" in l[i+2] and "\"approve-spec\"" in l[i+3] and "assert" not in l[i+3] and " = " not in l[i+3]]; gr=[f"{p.name}:{i+1}" for p,l in L.items() for i,x in enumerate(l) if "\"-b\", \"main\"" in x and "\"init\"" in x and any("--allow-empty" in y for y in l[i:i+4])]; print(f"approved-parent sequences: {len(ap)}", *ap); print(f"empty-commit repo setups: {len(gr)}", *gr)'`
- THEN each of the two lines reports either `0`, or `1` followed by a single site in `_cli.py`

### Requirement: The refactor keeps every test and assertion but the one duplicate
Across this change's own merges and unmerged commits, the harness suite SHALL lose exactly the one duplicate test and gain none, and every assert statement in every other test function MUST still be present in that function.

#### Scenario: Only the duplicate test and its assertions are gone
The command compares each `Merge factory/T-0045.<n>` commit reachable from HEAD with its first parent, and `git merge-base HEAD main` with HEAD, and adds up the results, so changes other tickets make to the same files are never counted. A collection failure shows as removed tests. tar may print a locale warning on stderr; it is not part of the result.
- WHEN `T=$(mktemp -d); { for m in $(git log --format=%H --grep='^Merge factory/T-0045[.]' HEAD); do echo "$(git rev-parse "$m^1") $m"; done; echo "$(git merge-base HEAD main) $(git rev-parse HEAD)"; } | while read b h; do [ "$b" = "$h" ] && continue; for s in $b $h; do [ -d "$T/$s" ] || { mkdir "$T/$s" && git archive "$s" | tar -x -C "$T/$s" && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" "$T/$s/.venv" && (cd "$T/$s" && PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest --collect-only -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | grep '::' | sort > ids); }; done; echo "pair $b $h"; comm -23 "$T/$b/ids" "$T/$h/ids" | sed 's/^/removed /'; comm -13 "$T/$b/ids" "$T/$h/ids" | sed 's/^/added /'; .venv/bin/python -c 'import ast,pathlib,sys; A=lambda r: {f"{p.name}::{n.name}": {ast.unparse(a) for a in ast.walk(n) if isinstance(a,ast.Assert)} for p in sorted(pathlib.Path(r,"tests/factory").glob("test_*.py")) for n in ast.walk(ast.parse(p.read_text())) if isinstance(n,(ast.FunctionDef,ast.AsyncFunctionDef)) and n.name.startswith("test_")}; b,h=A(sys.argv[1]),A(sys.argv[2]); [print(f"missing {k}: {a[:80]}") for k in sorted(b) for a in sorted(b[k]-h.get(k,set()))]' "$T/$b" "$T/$h"; done > "$T/out"; for k in pair removed added missing; do echo "$k: $(grep -c "^$k " "$T/out")"; grep "^$k " "$T/out" | grep -v '^pair '; done; rm -rf "$T"`
- THEN `pair:` is at least 1; `removed: 1` is followed by exactly `removed tests/factory/test_p0_cli.py::test_run_finish_without_output_is_killed`; it prints `added: 0`; and it prints `missing: 2`, followed by two lines that both start `missing test_p0_cli.py::test_run_finish_without_output_is_killed:`

#### Scenario: The suite is shorter
The command adds up the test-file line counts over the same pairs as the scenario above.
- WHEN `{ for m in $(git log --format=%H --grep='^Merge factory/T-0045[.]' HEAD); do echo "$(git rev-parse "$m^1") $m"; done; echo "$(git merge-base HEAD main) $(git rev-parse HEAD)"; } | while read b h; do [ "$b" = "$h" ] && continue; for s in $b $h; do printf '%s ' $(git ls-tree --name-only "$s" tests/factory/ | grep '\.py$' | while read f; do git show "$s:$f"; done | wc -l); done; echo; done | awk '{n++; b+=$1; h+=$2} END {print "pairs: " n+0 "; test lines before: " b+0 ", after: " h+0 ", change: " h-b}'`
- THEN `pairs` is at least 1 and `change` is negative, and the verifier reports the line

### Requirement: A suite run writes nothing into the checkout
A run of the harness suite SHALL pass and leave every path of the checkout as it was, except pytest's own cache of the test modules in `tests/factory/__pycache__`.

#### Scenario: A suite run in a fresh clone passes and adds nothing to the checkout
The command gives pytest its own temporary directory under `/tmp`, as the existing harness-suite scenario does, and removes it when it ends.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && P=$(mktemp -d /tmp/t0045-suite.XXXXXX) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && cd $T/c && find . \( -path ./.git -o -path ./tests/factory/__pycache__ \) -prune -o -print | sort > $T/before && TMPDIR=$P .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | tail -1; find . \( -path ./.git -o -path ./tests/factory/__pycache__ \) -prune -o -print | sort > $T/after; echo "paths changed: $(comm -3 $T/before $T/after | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"; comm -3 $T/before $T/after; rm -rf "$P")`
- THEN the first line reports a number of passed tests and no `failed` or `error`, and the next line is `paths changed: 0` with nothing after it

### Requirement: One harness-suite run finishes in under three minutes
One run of the harness suite, as `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory` runs it after `uv sync --frozen`, SHALL pass every test and finish in under 180 seconds on the operator's machine.

#### Scenario: One suite run passes in under three minutes
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `git` and `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the script written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

```sh
cat > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0051-time.py <<'EOF'
# .venv/bin/python t0051-time.py N LIMIT CMD...: from the checkout under test, starts N copies of the shell
# command CMD at once, each with its own fresh TMPDIR under /tmp, and stops any copy still running
# LIMIT seconds after the start. Prints one line per copy, in order: its output's last line, or
# `stopped`, then ` | under LIMIT s` or ` | over LIMIT s` by its own wall time.
import os, shutil, subprocess, sys, tempfile, time
n, limit, cmd = int(sys.argv[1]), float(sys.argv[2]), " ".join(sys.argv[3:])
t0, runs = time.monotonic(), []
for _ in range(n):
    d = tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix="t0051-time.", dir="/tmp")
    runs.append((d, subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, text=True,
                                     env={**os.environ, "TMPDIR": d}, start_new_session=True)))
for d, p in runs:
    try:
        out, _ = p.communicate(timeout=max(0.1, limit - (time.monotonic() - t0)))
        last, took = (out.strip().splitlines() or [""])[-1], time.monotonic() - t0
    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
        os.killpg(p.pid, 9); p.communicate(); last, took = "stopped", limit + 1
    shutil.rmtree(d, ignore_errors=True)
    print(f"{last} | {'under' if took < limit else 'over'} {limit:g} s")
EOF
```

- WHEN `.venv/bin/python ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0051-time.py 1 180 .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory`
- THEN it prints one line that reports a number of passed tests, contains no `failed` or `error`, and ends with `| under 180 s`

### Requirement: Two harness-suite runs at once each finish in under five minutes
Two runs of the harness suite started at the same moment SHALL each pass every test and finish in under 300 seconds on the operator's machine.

#### Scenario: Two suite runs at once each pass in under five minutes
Needs the GIVEN block of "One suite run passes in under three minutes" run once.
- WHEN `.venv/bin/python ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0051-time.py 2 300 .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory`
- THEN it prints two lines, each of which reports a number of passed tests, contains no `failed` or `error`, and ends with `| under 300 s`

### Requirement: The suite's stand-in agent replies when several copies of one role start at once
Each stand-in for the `claude` program that the harness suite's driver tests use MUST reply with its JSON object and exit 0 when several copies of the same role start at the same moment and share one log.

#### Scenario: Four stand-ins of one role started together all reply, 200 times over
The script names the suite's helper module and its two stand-in programs, because this ticket's subject is the suite's own reliability (as the standing 2026-10-12 T-0045 decision allows for the suite's structure).
- GIVEN the script written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown

```sh
cat > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0051-standin.py <<'EOF'
# .venv/bin/python t0051-standin.py, from the checkout under test: for each stand-in `claude` of the
# harness suite (the intake one and the build one), 200 times, starts four copies of the same role
# at once from four run directories that share one log, as the driver does for the checkers of four
# sub-tickets. Prints `<stand-in>: 200 rounds, <n> with a copy that did not reply, counter <c>`, where
# a copy that did not reply exited non-zero or printed no JSON object, and <c> is the stand-in's own
# count of verifier calls at the end (800 when no call was lost).
import json, os, subprocess, sys, tempfile, pathlib
sys.path.insert(0, "tests")
from factory import _fixtures as F  # the suite's helper module (tests/factory/_fixtures.py)
for name in ("STANDIN", "BUILD_STANDIN"):
    t = pathlib.Path(tempfile.mkdtemp()); exe = t / "claude"
    exe.write_text(getattr(F, name).format(python=sys.executable)); exe.chmod(0o755)
    env = {**os.environ, "STANDIN_LOG": str(t / "claude.log"), "STANDIN_PLAYS": json.dumps({"verifier": [{"say": "x"}]})}
    bad = 0
    for i in range(200):
        dirs = [t / f"r{i}" / f"run-000{k}-verifier" for k in (1, 2, 3, 4)]
        for d in dirs:
            d.mkdir(parents=True)
        ps = [subprocess.Popen([str(exe)], cwd=d, env=env, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True) for d in dirs]
        res = [(p.wait(), p.stdout.read()) for p in ps]
        def replied(rc, out):
            try:
                return rc == 0 and isinstance(json.loads(out), dict)
            except ValueError:
                return False
        bad += not all(replied(rc, out) for rc, out in res)
    nf = t / "claude.log.n-verifier"
    print(f"{name}: 200 rounds, {bad} with a copy that did not reply, counter {nf.read_text().strip() if nf.exists() else 'none'}")
EOF
```

- WHEN `.venv/bin/python -B ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0051-standin.py`
- THEN it prints exactly `STANDIN: 200 rounds, 0 with a copy that did not reply, counter 800`, then `BUILD_STANDIN: 200 rounds, 0 with a copy that did not reply, counter 800`

### Requirement: This change keeps every test and assertion but the two the waiting park reason changes
Across this change's own merges and unmerged commits, the harness suite SHALL lose no test, and every assert statement in every existing test function MUST still be present in that function, except the two assertions listed under Tests to change.

#### Scenario: No test is removed and only the two listed assertions change
The command compares each `Merge factory/T-0051.<n>` commit reachable from HEAD with its first parent, and `git merge-base HEAD main` with HEAD, and adds up the results, so changes other tickets make to the same files are never counted. A collection failure shows as removed tests. tar may print a locale warning on stderr; it is not part of the result.
- WHEN `T=$(mktemp -d); { for m in $(git log --format=%H --grep='^Merge factory/T-0051[.]' HEAD); do echo "$(git rev-parse "$m^1") $m"; done; echo "$(git merge-base HEAD main) $(git rev-parse HEAD)"; } | while read b h; do [ "$b" = "$h" ] && continue; for s in $b $h; do [ -d "$T/$s" ] || { mkdir "$T/$s" && git archive "$s" | tar -x -C "$T/$s" && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" "$T/$s/.venv" && (cd "$T/$s" && PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest --collect-only -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | grep '::' | sort > ids); }; done; echo "pair $b $h"; comm -23 "$T/$b/ids" "$T/$h/ids" | sed 's/^/removed /'; comm -13 "$T/$b/ids" "$T/$h/ids" | sed 's/^/added /'; .venv/bin/python -c 'import ast,pathlib,sys; A=lambda r: {f"{p.name}::{n.name}": {ast.unparse(a) for a in ast.walk(n) if isinstance(a,ast.Assert)} for p in sorted(pathlib.Path(r,"tests/factory").glob("test_*.py")) for n in ast.walk(ast.parse(p.read_text())) if isinstance(n,(ast.FunctionDef,ast.AsyncFunctionDef)) and n.name.startswith("test_")}; b,h=A(sys.argv[1]),A(sys.argv[2]); [print(f"missing {k}: {a[:80]}") for k in sorted(b) for a in sorted(b[k]-h.get(k,set()))]' "$T/$b" "$T/$h"; done > "$T/out"; for k in pair removed added missing; do echo "$k: $(grep -c "^$k " "$T/out")"; grep "^$k " "$T/out" | grep -v '^pair '; done; rm -rf "$T"`
- THEN `pair:` is at least 1; it prints `removed: 0`; every `added` line names a test in `tests/factory/test_empty_output.py`; and it prints `missing: 2`, followed by exactly one line that starts `missing test_drive.py::test_two_empty_outputs_park_with_both_runs_and_keep_the_last_message: assert parked['reason'] == 'EMPTY-OUTPUT from triage'` and one that starts `missing test_empty_output.py::test_last_message_is_kept_for_an_empty_output_run: assert res == {'ok': True, 'run_id': s.rid, 'last_message':`

### Requirement: The suite tests the launch copy, a reformatted reply and the route back to checks, and changes no existing test
The harness suite SHALL pass with no existing test file changed or deleted. The test files this change adds SHALL each fail, with at least one failed test, when run against the harness code of the change's base.

#### Scenario: The suite passes, no existing test changes, and every test file this change adds fails on the base
Per the standing T-0023 decision, the command gives pytest its own temporary directory under `/tmp` and removes it when it ends. The base is `git merge-base HEAD main`; its tree is unpacked into that directory, and the added files are copied in beside its tests.
- WHEN `(P=$(mktemp -d /tmp/t0054-suite.XXXXXX) && TMPDIR=$P uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | tail -1; B=$(git merge-base HEAD main); echo "changed=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=DMR $B HEAD -- tests | grep -c .) added=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=A $B HEAD -- tests | grep -c '/test_[^/]*\.py$')"; mkdir $P/base && git archive $B | tar -x -C $P/base && for f in $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=A $B HEAD -- tests); do mkdir -p $P/base/${f%/*} && cp $f $P/base/$f; done; for f in $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=A $B HEAD -- tests | grep '/test_[^/]*\.py$'); do echo "$f on the base: $(cd $P/base && TMPDIR=$P uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider $f 2>&1 | tail -1 | sed 's/ in [0-9.]*s.*//')"; done; rm -rf "$P")`
- THEN the first line reports a number of passed tests and no `failed` or `error`; the second is `changed=0 added=<n>` with n at least 1; then n lines follow, each `<added test file> on the base: <pytest summary>`, where every summary includes `failed`

### Requirement: The suite passes with this change, which changes only the stats test the --accept-harness refusal overturns
The harness suite SHALL pass with this change, and among existing test files this change MUST modify or delete only `tests/factory/test_stats.py`.

#### Scenario: The harness suite passes
- WHEN `(uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | tail -1)`
- THEN its last line reports tests passed and no `failed` or `error`

#### Scenario: The only existing test file changed is the stats test
- WHEN `(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=MD $(git merge-base main HEAD) HEAD -- tests/factory)`
- THEN it prints nothing, or only `tests/factory/test_stats.py`

## Current truth: live-store-guard

# live-store-guard

## Requirements

### Requirement: Unmarked writes to a live store are refused while a role run is in flight there
While any run is in flight on an instance's own store, every `factory` command on that store except `ticket show`, `ticket join`, `results show`, `config`, `launch-script`, `status parse`, `log tail`, `paths`, `drive` and `stats`, none of them given `--accept-harness`, MUST be refused with exit 2, writing nothing to the store, the instance or the repository, unless its environment has `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1`; the refusal SHALL name a throwaway `FACTORY_STATE` and SHALL NOT name the marker.

#### Scenario: Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the three fixture files written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names them reuses them)

#### Scenario: A launch copy is written unmarked while a run is in flight, and the target is unchanged
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once. The unmarked `ticket new` beside it shows the fence is up.

- THEN it prints exactly `launch=0 new=2 copies=1 store=unchanged`

### Requirement: Writes from inside a store's run directories or code checkouts are refused, marked or not
Every `factory` command on an instance's own store except the read-only list above MUST be refused with exit 2, writing nothing, when the caller's directory lies under that store's `runs/` or `worktrees/`, whether or not its environment has `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` and whether or not any run is in flight.

#### Scenario: Marked writes from a run's scratch directory or a worktree directory are refused, init included

### Requirement: Reads, marked commands from outside the store, throwaway stores and idle stores stay open
While a run is in flight on the live store, the read-only commands SHALL succeed from anywhere, a command with `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` run from outside the store's `runs/` and `worktrees/` SHALL succeed as before, and a command on a throwaway store (`FACTORY_STATE` naming another store) SHALL NOT be fenced from any directory; with no run in flight, unmarked writes from outside those directories SHALL succeed as before.

- THEN it prints exactly `new=0 decision=0`

### Requirement: The marker does not lift the harness lock
A command with `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` on an instance's own store MUST still be refused by the harness lock's uncommitted-edit check, with exit 2 and nothing written, whether or not a run is in flight.

#### Scenario: A marked write from a harness checkout with an uncommitted edit is still refused
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $T/c/bin/factory init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md && $T/c/bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null && $T/c/bin/factory run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null && echo '# uncommitted edit' >> $T/c/factory/status.py && S0=$(find $T/tgt/.factory -type f -exec cksum {} + | sort | cksum) && FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 $T/c/bin/factory decision add T-0001 x >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? lock=$(head -1 $T/err | grep -c 'has uncommitted changes:$') store=$([ "$(find $T/tgt/.factory -type f -exec cksum {} + | sort | cksum)" = "$S0" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `exit=2 lock=1 store=unchanged`

### Requirement: factory stats reads any store under any harness revision and writes nothing
`factory stats` MUST run on an instance's own store while a run is in flight there, from inside that store's `runs/`, and when the instance's `harness.lock` names another revision, exiting 0 and writing nothing, and with no `--store` it SHALL read the store of the instance found from the caller's directory.

#### Scenario: Stats reads a live store with a run in flight and an unaccepted harness, and writes nothing
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once. T-0001's triage run is in flight on the target's own store, and the lock is overwritten to name another revision, so an ordinary read is refused.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-inflight.sh && echo 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 > $T/tgt/.factory/harness.lock && S0=$(snap); $B stats > $T/o1 2>/dev/null; a=$?; cd $W && $B stats > $T/o2 2>/dev/null; b=$?; cd $T/tgt && $B ticket show T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1; c=$?; echo "here=$a inside=$b store=$([ "$(snap)" = "$S0" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed) own=$(grep -cxF "Stores: $S" $T/o1) locked=$c")`
- THEN it prints exactly `here=0 inside=0 store=unchanged own=1 locked=2`

### Requirement: init, paths and stats refuse --accept-harness and name a command that accepts it
`factory --accept-harness <sha>` given with `init`, `paths` or `stats` MUST be refused with exit 2 and `{"ok": false, …}` on stdout, writing nothing. The refusal SHALL name the command and give `factory --accept-harness <sha> config` with the same sha. Without the flag, `paths` and `stats` SHALL still run under a lock that names another revision, and every other command SHALL keep its lock behaviour.

#### Scenario: The flag with init, paths or stats is refused, names config, and writes nothing, even where init would create an instance
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; Z=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567; snap() { find . -path ./.git -prune -o -type f -exec cksum {} + | sort | cksum; }; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && git init -q -b main $T/fresh && git -C $T/fresh -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && S0=$(snap) && for c in init paths stats; do $B --accept-harness $Z $c >$T/o 2>$T/e; echo "$c: exit=$? named=$(grep -cw "$c" $T/e) hint=$(grep -cF -- "factory --accept-harness $Z config" $T/e) json=$(grep -c '"ok": false' $T/o)"; done; echo "target=$([ "$(snap)" = "$S0" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)"; cd $T/fresh && $B --accept-harness $Z init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "fresh: exit=$? files=$(find . -path ./.git -prune -o -type f -print | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `init: exit=2 named=1 hint=1 json=1`, `paths: exit=2 named=1 hint=1 json=1`, `stats: exit=2 named=1 hint=1 json=1`, `target=unchanged`, `fresh: exit=2 files=0`, one per line

#### Scenario: Without the flag paths and stats still run under another lock, and config still accepts a revision
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && R=$($B paths | sed -n 's/.*"harness_revision": "\([0-9a-f]*\)".*/\1/p') && echo 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 > .factory/harness.lock && $B paths >/dev/null 2>&1; p=$?; $B stats >/dev/null 2>&1; s=$?; $B config >/dev/null 2>&1; c=$?; $B --accept-harness $R config >/dev/null 2>&1; a=$?; echo "paths=$p stats=$s config=$c accept=$a lock=$([ "$(cat .factory/harness.lock)" = "$R" ] && echo accepted || echo other)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `paths=0 stats=0 config=2 accept=0 lock=accepted`

## Current truth: role-escalations

# role-escalations

## Requirements

### Requirement: The implementer and verifier leave declared protected paths out of ESCALATIONS
The system prompt of every implementer and verifier run SHALL say that a protected path the sub-ticket declares is not an escalation, that the code reviewer lists declared paths once for each head it reviews, that the role may name them but not under ESCALATIONS, and that a protected path the sub-ticket does not declare still goes under ESCALATIONS.

#### Scenario: Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the fixture file written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

```sh
cat > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh <<'EOF'
# Sourced from the repo root of the checkout under test. Defines `prompt <role>`: starts one run of

```

- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh && for r in implementer verifier; do P=$(prompt $r); echo "$r declared=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'A protected path the sub-ticket declares is not an escalation') notunder=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'but not under ESCALATIONS') undeclared=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'still goes under ESCALATIONS when the sub-ticket does not declare it')"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer declared=1 notunder=1 undeclared=1`, then `verifier declared=1 notunder=1 undeclared=1`

### Requirement: Every role still escalates an undeclared protected path, and the code reviewer still lists declared ones
The system prompts of implementer, code reviewer and verifier runs MUST still carry the preamble's rule to escalate a protected path that the approved spec's Risk section does not declare. The code reviewer's prompt MUST still carry check 6's rule to ESCALATE a path the sub-ticket does not declare and to list a declared one under ESCALATIONS. Check 6 SHALL say that the merge gate merges a path the approved spec's Risk section declares with no further approval, and SHALL NOT promise a human approval at merge.

#### Scenario: All three run prompts keep the undeclared-path rule and the reviewer keeps check 6
Needs the GIVEN block of "Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule" (current truth, role-escalations) run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh && u="a protected path the approved spec's Risk section does not declare"; for r in implementer reviewer verifier; do echo "$r undeclared=$(prompt $r | grep -cF "$u")"; done; echo "check6=$(prompt reviewer | grep -cF '6. Protected paths touched? If the sub-ticket does not declare them, ESCALATE. If it does, list them under ESCALATIONS')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer undeclared=1`, `reviewer undeclared=1`, `verifier undeclared=1`, `check6=1`, one per line

#### Scenario: The reviewer run prompt says what the merge gate checks
Needs the GIVEN block of "Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule" (current truth, role-escalations) run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh && P=$(prompt reviewer); echo "gate=$(echo "$P" | grep -c "The merge gate merges a path the approved spec's Risk section declares with no further approval") promise=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'will require a human approval')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `gate=1 promise=0`

## Current truth: spec-amendment

# spec-amendment

## Requirements

### Requirement: A human amends a pinned spec whose intent is unchanged
`factory spec amend PARENT --file F --reason LINE --intent unchanged`, on a ticket with an approved spec, before archive, with no run in flight on it or its sub-tickets, MUST write F as the next spec version and make it the approved one, re-pin the change folder from F while keeping its `tasks.md`, and SHALL leave merged sub-tickets merged.

#### Scenario: An intent-unchanged amendment re-pins the change and keeps the plan's tasks
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `git` and `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the fixture file written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

```sh

### Requirement: Later runs receive the amended spec, and the record names what changed
After an amendment, a role run that reads the pinned spec SHALL receive the amended version, and the amendment record MUST list each changed scenario and each sub-ticket merged before it, with the reason, and the log MUST record a `spec.amended` event.

#### Scenario: A later implementer run receives the amended spec, and the record lists what changed
Needs the GIVEN block of "An intent-unchanged amendment re-pins the change and keeps the plan's tasks" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0027-amend.sh && plan 'ST-1 / First\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n\nST-2 / Second\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n' && bin/factory ticket set T-0001.1 status=merged >/dev/null; bin/factory spec amend T-0001 --file $T27/v2.md --reason "Seed the greeting." --intent unchanged >/dev/null 2>&1; A=$FACTORY_STATE/approvals/T-0001/amendment-1.md; echo "changed=$(cat $A 2>/dev/null | grep -cxF -- '- changed: Greeting is printed') merged=$(cat $A 2>/dev/null | grep -cxF -e '- T-0001.1 / First: merged' -e '- T-0001.2 / Second: merged') reason=$(cat $A 2>/dev/null | grep -c 'Seed the greeting.') logged=$(bin/factory log tail --event spec.amended | grep -c '"ticket": "T-0001"')"; R=$(bin/factory run start --role implementer --ticket T-0001.2 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'); [ -n "$R" ] && bin/factory run compose $R >/dev/null; echo "amended=$(cat $FACTORY_STATE/runs/${R:-none}/input.md 2>/dev/null | grep -c 'echo hello') old=$(cat $FACTORY_STATE/runs/${R:-none}/input.md 2>/dev/null | grep -cw 'echo hi') run_version=$(sed -n 's/^spec_version: //p' $FACTORY_STATE/runs/${R:-none}/meta.yaml 2>/dev/null)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `changed=1 merged=1 reason=1 logged=1`, then `amended=1 old=0 run_version=2`

### Requirement: Archive writes the amended version into current truth
`factory archive` after an amendment SHALL write the amended version's scenarios into current truth, not the version first approved.

#### Scenario: Archive after an amendment writes the amended scenario
Needs the GIVEN block of "An intent-unchanged amendment re-pins the change and keeps the plan's tasks" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0027-amend.sh && bin/factory spec amend T-0001 --file $T27/v2.md --reason "Seed the greeting." --intent unchanged >/dev/null 2>&1; bin/factory archive T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "archive=$? hello=$(grep -c 'echo hello' $FACTORY_STATE/openspec/specs/demo/spec.md) hi=$(grep -cw 'echo hi' $FACTORY_STATE/openspec/specs/demo/spec.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `archive=0 hello=1 hi=0`

### Requirement: An amendment that changes intent is refused with a restart note
`factory spec amend` MUST refuse with `"ok": false` and exit 2, writing nothing, when `--intent changed` is given or when the amended version changes the Problem, a Decisions line, or a requirement's name, operation or statement, and the refusal SHALL name each such change and say which sub-tickets have merged, which a restart would discard, and the commands to re-spec or to close and re-file.

#### Scenario: An amendment declared or found to change intent is refused, naming what a restart keeps and discards
Needs the GIVEN block of "An intent-unchanged amendment re-pins the change and keeps the plan's tasks" run once.

### Requirement: An amendment that cannot be applied is refused and writes nothing
`factory spec amend` MUST refuse with `"ok": false` and exit 2, writing no version, record or pin, when the ticket was archived, when it is a sub-ticket, when the reason is not one line, when the version fails the gate's checks, or while a run is in flight on the ticket or one of its sub-tickets, and the in-flight refusal SHALL name the run.

#### Scenario: An amendment after archive is refused
Needs the GIVEN block of "An intent-unchanged amendment re-pins the change and keeps the plan's tasks" run once.

#### Scenario: A malformed amendment, a sub-ticket target and a two-line reason are refused and write nothing
Needs the GIVEN block of "An intent-unchanged amendment re-pins the change and keeps the plan's tasks" run once.

## Decision log (decisions.md): standing decisions, read-only

2026-10-04 T-0023 `resolve --ruling F` also accepts a park whose reason starts with `BLOCKED`. It writes F as the next `approvals/<id>/ruling-<n>.md` and returns the sub-ticket to `ready-for-implementer` at the same round.
2026-10-04 T-0023 `resolve PARENT --replan F` moves a parked parent whose sub-tickets have all merged to `ready-for-planner`, with F as its next ruling. The planner receives F and plans the fix. Rejected: the requester's `--replan --file <plan>` straight to `planned`. It needs a new routing edge, which the queue policy does not count as small. It would also skip the planner. `dev/build-harness.spec.md` already sends a re-plan through the planner.
2026-10-04 T-0023 On a re-plan, the planner's input lists the parent's existing sub-tickets, each with its title and state. The human's note F therefore needs to say only what to fix. Rejected: asking the human to restate in F what has merged, which the store already knows.
2026-10-04 T-0023 Sub-tickets that a later plan adds take the next free ids under the parent, and their `Depends on:` lines may name the parent's existing sub-tickets. A plan head line that reuses an existing sub-ticket's id is refused. Rejected: honouring explicit non-colliding ids, a second numbering rule that the planner's free-form ids would make ambiguous.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A park reason is never blank. When the clerk relays an empty stderr, the workflows use the refusal's JSON `error`, and failing that `exit <n>, no JSON on stdout` or `exit <n>, no error text`. Rejected: editing each of the 26 reason sites.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A redispatch sets aside a checker's rows only when they did not pass. The reviewer's row is kept when it is `APPROVE`. The verifier and gate rows are kept together when they are `VERIFIED` and `PASS`, because one verifier run writes both. The build then runs only the checkers with no row on that commit. After an implementer run it still runs both. Rejected: a `--roles` flag on redispatch, which no reported case needs.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The store gets a `.gitattributes` holding `runs/** -whitespace`. `init` and every `run start` write it the way they already write `.gitignore`. Rejected: rewriting committed records, and excluding the store path inside each gate command.
2026-10-04 T-0023 `init` refuses, with exit 2 and nothing written, to create an instance while `FACTORY_STATE` names another store. A compose with no `context.md` refuses with exit 2. Rejected: writing every instance piece from a throwaway-store `init`. That contradicts the rule that such a run initialises only that store.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A relative `FACTORY_INSTANCE`, `FACTORY_STATE` or `FACTORY_REPO` resolves against the caller's directory: `FACTORY_CWD`, else the working directory.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The suite's own-store cases that are not about the uncommitted-edit refusal run the CLI through a test-only launcher that stubs that one check. The refusal itself keeps its tests on a clone's real `bin/factory`. Rejected: a switch the production CLI honours, which would loosen the check. Also rejected: running every case from a committed snapshot of the working tree, which changes every assertion that names this checkout's revision or paths.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The suite scenario gives pytest a fresh temporary directory under `/tmp` and removes it afterwards. Four existing tests need a temporary directory outside every repository, and an agent's scratch directory lies inside this one. The scenario states this in its command, so no role has to choose between its scratch rule and a valid run. Rejected: fixing those four tests in this ticket, which is beyond H8 and needs its own design (Out-of-scope observations).
2026-10-04 T-0023 The workflow-script fixes are checked by acceptance scenarios that run the scripts under node with a stub clerk. They get no suite test, because the suite does not need node today and adding that would change what the gate needs.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The change is built as four seams (design.md, "Size and seams"). They share one changelog entry, 51.
2026-10-04 T-0024 T-0024: instance B keeps the spec store created 2026-10-04 by run-0196; its tickets close by archive into current truth (operator)
2026-10-04 T-0024 While a role run is in flight on a live store, a human or runner writes it by prefixing that one command with FACTORY_DISPATCH=1; README documents it and the refusal text never names it (operator)
2026-10-04 T-0024 Instance B keeps the spec store that run-0196 created. Its tickets close by archive into current truth, and `decisions.md` keeps reaching the spec writer, critic and planner. The operator decided this in the first answer to this ticket, and it is already recorded in `decisions.md`. This is a standing decision. This ticket touches README, so it also corrects README's stale "never entered it" line, as that answer directs.
2026-10-04 T-0024 While a role run is in flight on a live store, the operator or a runner session writes it by putting `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` in front of that one command. README documents this. The refusal text never names the marker. The operator decided this in the same answer, and it is already recorded in `decisions.md`. This is a standing decision for every runner session, including the Driver session that runs the Nanobot fork's instance (instance A).
2026-10-04 T-0024 A write is refused, marker or not and run in flight or not, when the caller's directory lies under the own store's `runs/` or `worktrees/`. The operator's gate review asked for this rule. Rejected: applying it only while a run is in flight, because a process a role left running in its run directory would then write freely once the store went idle. Rejected: letting the marker lift it, because the rule exists so that a copied or exported marker does not help from there. This is a standing decision: the operator and runner sessions run store writes from outside the store.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The location rule is checked first, then the marker, then the in-flight list.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The in-flight rule acts only on an instance's own store, and only while at least one run is in flight on any ticket of that store. Rejected: refusing every unmarked write at all times, as the requester proposed. The operator would then need the marker on every command and would export it in the shell, and every role run started from that shell would inherit it. The operator's decision on the marker assumes unmarked writes when nothing is in flight.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The in-flight rule checks every ticket's in-flight list, not only the calling ticket's. The tool cannot tell which run, if any, is calling.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The marker is the environment variable `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1`. Both workflow scripts put it in front of every clerk command. Rejected: the requester's exemption for "a human's `--by`". Human commands have no `--by`, and `ticket transition` requires one from everyone.
2026-10-04 T-0024 A write is every command except a fixed read-only list: `ticket show`, `ticket join`, `results show`, `config`, `status parse`, `log tail` and `paths`. Any command given `--accept-harness` is a write, because it rewrites the lock and logs. A new command is fenced until someone adds it to the list. Rejected: the requester's list of ten write commands. It misses writes such as `ticket set`, `ticket park`, `ticket head`, `ticket ready-implementers`, `ticket parent-check`, `run compose` and `spec add`.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The refusal exits 2 and writes nothing. Its text is `role runs may not write the live store (<detail>); use a throwaway FACTORY_STATE`. The detail is `<store>; in flight: <run ids>` for the in-flight rule and `<store>; called from inside its runs/` (or `worktrees/`) for the location rule. The advice is meant for a role. The operator learns the marker from README.
2026-10-04 T-0024 A run left in flight by a dead workflow keeps the in-flight rule up. The operator clears it with a marked `run finish <run> --status-override KILLED`, run from the repository root, and README says so. Rejected: a timeout that drops the fence by itself. A long run that is still working would lose the fence.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The fence guards against accidents, not against a determined agent. It is not a security boundary. A role working from outside the store that copies the marker from the workflow scripts or README still gets through. That is recorded under Risk rather than designed around. Isolating role runs at the operating-system level is issue #37.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The fence is checked before the harness lock, the check that each instance runs only the harness revision it has accepted. A fenced command is refused before it reaches the lock, so a fenced `--accept-harness` rewrites nothing. A marked command still meets the lock and its uncommitted-edit refusal unchanged, so the marker cannot be used to get past the lock. Rejected: checking the fence after the lock, because `--accept-harness` rewrites the lock inside that check, so a fenced acceptance would write before it was refused.
2026-10-04 T-0024 Part B (a preamble line) is cut. The incident came from the test suite, not from a command the role typed, so a preamble line would not have stopped it. The refusal text gives the same advice at the moment it matters.
2026-10-04 T-0024 Part C (the tripwire on the store root) is cut. Role runs legitimately write their own run directory in the store (`output.md`, `scratch/`). Clerk commands for other tickets' runs also write the store during a run. A comparison of the store root therefore cannot tell whose write it saw. The fence refuses the write before it happens.
2026-10-04 T-0022 Removing clearly redundant work (a step, run or check that cannot change any outcome) is pre-approved, provided every refusal the pipeline gives today still fires (operator, 2026-10-04: 'slashing clearly redundant work is always going to be OK, if we trust our process')
2026-10-04 T-0022 Under a sub-ticket's Tests to change, the planner may list tests an earlier sibling of the same parent added, with a harness check that each first appeared in a sibling's merge; pre-existing tests still need the approved spec (operator, #40)
2026-10-04 T-0025 The store lives on its own branch, `factory-store`, checked out as a git worktree at the store's path (B1). This is for the operator to confirm at the spec gate. Rejected: B2, the branch written through git plumbing with no working copy. It needs new harness commands to snapshot, show and restore the store, and `git clean -fdx` in the integration checkout deletes the store (Evidence). Rejected: A, a gate exception (operator, 2026-10-04).
2026-10-04 T-0025 A store path must be one the integration branch has never tracked. Both existing stores move from `.factory/state` to `.factory/store`. Rejected: keeping `.factory/state`, where checking out an older commit overwrote an uncommitted record and checking `main` out again deleted it (Evidence).
2026-10-04 T-0025 The branch is named `factory-store`, and the design doc and build spec drop the name `tickets` for it. Rejected: `tickets`, a generic name in a target repo whose branches serve other work, such as the Nanobot repo, which shares its objects with another checkout.
2026-10-04 T-0025 `init` creates a new store as a worktree on an unborn `factory-store` branch, and the operator makes the first commit. On a clone where the branch already exists, `init` checks it out, which restores the store. Rejected: `init` committing, which needs a git identity, and the suite runs under a throwaway HOME that has none.
2026-10-04 T-0025 When no local `factory-store` exists and more than one remote carries it, `init` refuses and names each `<remote>/factory-store`. The operator picks one with `git branch factory-store <remote>/factory-store` and runs `init` again. Rejected: creating a new empty branch, which would silently start a second store history beside the pushed one. Also rejected: preferring `origin`, a guess about which remote is canonical.
2026-10-04 T-0025 With `FACTORY_INSTANCE` unset, `init` refuses, writing nothing, when the caller's git top level is a checkout of `factory-store`. It also refuses when the instance found by walking up from the caller's directory has a store that is that top level, or that contains it in the same repository (the same git common directory). These are the cases where it would build a phantom instance inside the live store. The second condition does not depend on which branch or commit the store has checked out, so a detached store HEAD does not open the route again (operator, round 2 change request N2). The same-repository qualifier keeps `init` working in a separate throwaway repository under a run's scratch directory (Evidence). Rejected: "contains" without that qualifier, which would refuse every suite `init` run with pytest's temporary directory inside a store. Rejected: taking the repository from the parent of `--git-common-dir`. That is the main worktree, which for the Nanobot instance is `~/dev/nanobot`, another checkout on another branch, and for the runtime checkout is `~/dev/spec-factory` (Evidence).
2026-10-04 T-0025 In `init`, every refusal and the store-worktree step come before any instance file is written, so a failed worktree step (for example, git's "already used by worktree" when `init` runs in a code checkout of a repo whose store branch is checked out elsewhere) leaves nothing behind.
2026-10-04 T-0025 The integration checkout ignores the store through the repo's git exclude file, which `init` and `store migrate` write. Rejected: a line in the target's tracked `.gitignore`. That would change the target's code to record a fact about one clone.
2026-10-04 T-0025 A new command, `factory store migrate --to PATH`, moves an existing store. It refuses unless the store is idle and committed, and it leaves the integration-branch side uncommitted for the operator to review. Rejected: a hand procedure, untested, run once on each repo by a different session.
2026-10-04 T-0025 `store migrate` deletes the old store directory only after it has checked that every ignored file (run scratch directories, tripwire baselines) was copied byte for byte. If the check fails, it undoes its own worktree and branch and leaves the old store as it was. Rejected: relying on `git status` in the new checkout, which cannot see ignored files.
2026-10-04 T-0025 The store branch starts with one commit whose tree is the store as last committed on the integration branch, and whose message names that commit. Earlier history stays readable with `git log <that commit> -- .factory/state`. Rejected: rewriting history with a subtree split. It would follow only part of the store's past, which began at `intake/state`, and it adds nothing that `main`'s history does not already keep.
2026-10-04 T-0025 An instance whose store is still a plain directory keeps working unchanged. `init` leaves such a store alone and points to `store migrate`. The harness reads and writes the store only through `state_dir`, so it runs with either layout.
2026-10-04 T-0022 A sub-ticket's "Tests to change" may list a test file that an earlier sibling of the same parent added, one line each: `` `<file>[::<test>]` (added by <sibling ID>): <reason> ``. The harness reads only lines of that form inside the "Tests to change" field, and checks the file, not the test function. Rejected: checking test functions. The implementer rule puts new tests in new files, so a file is what a sibling adds, and git records files.
2026-10-04 T-0022 A listed file counts as added by a sibling when it is absent at the parent's `parent_base`, and the first commit since then on the integration branch that added it lies inside one merged sibling's recorded merge (reachable from its `main_after`, not from its `base_before`). Any merged sibling of the parent counts, including those from an earlier plan. The sibling ID on the line is for the reader and is not matched. Rejected: matching the named ID, because the planner's IDs (`ST-1`) differ from the store's (`T-0001.1`) and the operator's rule names no particular sibling.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The check runs in `run start` for every implementer run of a sub-ticket: first dispatch, fix rounds and catch-up runs. Every dispatch passes through that one place. Rejected: checking when the plan is added, when no sibling has merged yet. Rejected: checking at the merge gate, after the implementer has already edited the test. Rejected: checking where a waiting sub-ticket is released, which happens in two places and never for a sub-ticket with no dependencies.
2026-10-04 T-0022 A failed check refuses the run start with exit 2, writes nothing, and gives an error that starts `BLOCKED from harness:` and names the file. The build workflow parks the sub-ticket with that error as the reason, so `resolve --ruling` handles it like an implementer's BLOCKED. That is what the operator's "parks for the operator, as today" describes. Rejected: a new kind of park with its own resolve verb. Rejected: having `run start` park the ticket itself, which would break the rule that a refusal writes nothing.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The preamble's guardrail sentence and the code reviewer's test-integrity check also accept a sibling entry that the harness has checked. Without them, the implementer and reviewer would still treat the edit as forbidden, and the park would remain.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The earlier sibling names the tests a later sibling will break under a new planner field, "Interim tests". The harness does not read it.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The critic's check for an omitted test goes under rubric 1 (Grounded), where the requester asked for it.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The requester's acceptance, a re-plan and re-spec of Nanobot T-0002 that the operator compares side by side, is an Operator step, not an acceptance scenario. Running it needs the Nanobot store and real agents, which a verifier must not touch.
2026-10-04 T-0032 Empty role output (#41, T-0032): labelled EMPTY-OUTPUT with the last message, re-dispatched once automatically, parked on a second; the code reviewer judges the diff and leaves the test suite and gates to the verifier.
2026-10-04 T-0029 Only the code reviewer lists declared protected paths, once for each head it reviews. The implementer and verifier may name them in their output, but not under ESCALATIONS. This is a standing decision: a later prompt change should not give another role a declared-path notice. The operator pre-approved it on 2026-10-04 (`.factory/answers/operator-decisions-2026-10-04.md`), under the standing decision that removing clearly redundant work is allowed when every refusal still fires.
2026-10-04 T-0029 A fix round makes a new head, so it gets its own reviewer notice, as today. Rejected: one notice per sub-ticket. A fix round can change a declared path again, and the operator would not hear about it.
2026-10-04 T-0029 The new rule also keeps one escalation for a declared path: when the change does something to it that the spec does not describe. An undeclared path still escalates as well. Rejected: the retro's wording "the reviewer lists declared paths for the merge gate". No local merge check reads the declaration, so that sentence would teach the roles something false.
2026-10-04 T-0029 The implementer and verifier get the same bullet word for word, as the last bullet under RULES. That way one text is checked in both prompts.
2026-10-04 T-0029 The changelog records the count re-derived from the store log (10 runs, 30 of 205 items). Rejected: the retro's 26 of 139, which its own table contradicts with 38.
2026-10-04 T-0029 Acceptance checks the composed run prompts and the document copies. The request's own check (on the next build, one notice per head, from the reviewer) is kept as an operator step. Rejected: an acceptance item that waits for a real build. The verifier cannot run one, and how a model follows a prompt rule is not something a check on one commit can prove.
2026-10-05 T-0028 Part A overturns the cut in T-0016's spec. The path-scoped gate skip is built as the operator pre-approved it, with no repository's configuration changed. Rejected: cutting it again because it would have skipped almost no past run. The request expects a small saving here and still asks for the mechanism. Part A is a separate part, so the operator can delete it and its scenarios at the gate.
2026-10-05 T-0028 A gate command's `paths` are git pathspecs. A command is skipped when `git diff --name-only <base>...<head> -- <paths>` lists no file. Include entries (`src/`) and exclude entries (`:(exclude)dev/`) both work. Rejected: a glob matcher of our own, a second matching rule that could disagree with git's. Standing: later tickets and instance configs use pathspec semantics.
2026-10-05 T-0028 If this repository's suite is ever scoped, its paths should exclude what it does not read rather than list what it does: `:(exclude)dev/` and `:(exclude)README.md`. Rejected: the requester's inclusion list, which leaves out `.gitignore` and any new top-level file, so it would skip the suite on changes that fail it.
2026-10-05 T-0028 The harness decides the skip when a reviewer or verifier run starts on a sub-ticket. It reads the live instance's configuration and that run's base and head. The verifier is told which commands are skipped, so it does not decide. Rejected: letting the verifier judge relevance, which no record could check.
2026-10-05 T-0028 Each skipped command is recorded twice: in the checker run's `meta.yaml` (`gate_skipped`) and on the `ci` row (`skipped`). Each entry has the command, `status: SKIPPED` and the reason. The row's PASS or FAIL still comes from the verifier's `Gate suite:` line, over the commands that ran.
2026-10-05 T-0028 A malformed gate entry refuses every implementer, reviewer and verifier run start with exit 2, before a run is created. A malformed entry is anything other than a string, or a mapping with a non-empty string `command` and an optional non-empty list of non-empty strings `paths`, with no other key. Rejected: treating a typo such as `path:` as unscoped. The operator would believe a scope is in force that is not.
2026-10-05 T-0028 An empty `paths` list is refused. Rejected: reading it as "covers nothing", which would skip the command on every diff.
2026-10-05 T-0028 The planner is skipped when all of these hold, and otherwise runs as today: the parent has no sub-ticket and no earlier planner run; its latest spec-writer run did not end NEEDS-SPLIT; and its approved spec has no `##` or `###` heading, other than a `### Requirement:` line, that contains the word seam or seams. This sorts all thirteen past parents as they were built (Evidence). Rejected: the requester's "exactly one lettered part", which would have skipped none of the nine. Rejected: NEEDS-SPLIT alone, which would have built T-0025's two parts, about 470 lines, as one sub-ticket. Standing: the planner runs only for a spec that is split, re-planned or already planned once.
2026-10-05 T-0028 To force the planner on a spec that meets every condition, the operator adds a `### Size and seams` heading in a gate edit (`approve-spec --edit`). No new flag.
2026-10-05 T-0028 The whole-spec sub-ticket is `<parent>.1`, at `ready-for-implementer`, with no dependency. Its text names every scenario of the approved spec, one `- <name>` line each. For everything else it points to the spec: every lettered part, the spec's labels, its Tests to change and its Risk list. Because it names every scenario, the parent closes on its VERIFIED run under the existing rule (part C).
2026-10-05 T-0028 The store records the skip three ways: a `plan.skipped` event in the log with its reason, the parent's plan file (`plans/<parent>.md`), and the change folder's `tasks.md` when the repository has a spec store. A planner-made plan writes the same two files.
2026-10-05 T-0028 A spec already applied on `main`, the planner's most frequent ESCALATE, is caught after the skip by the implementer's step 2 and by the verifier's base run of NEW checks (design part B, table). The catch costs an implementer run in place of a planner run. Rejected: a harness check of "already applied", which would need the agents' judgment of what the spec asks for.
2026-10-07 T-0032 Retry-once-then-park on a role's unusable output (#41's EMPTY-OUTPUT) is the general mechanism: later refusal kinds (#68 format, #67 spec-lint) register with it rather than adding their own. resolve --ruling should also accept a budget-kill or EMPTY-OUTPUT park (rulings had to be placed by hand on T-0029.1 and T-0028.1).
2026-10-07 T-0032 An empty output is `EMPTY-OUTPUT`, never a budget kill. That covers a missing or empty output file, an agent call that returns blank text, and one that returns `null` (a user skip or a terminal API error). Rejected: keeping a budget-kill path for some of these. The harness enforces no budget, and the agent call reports no reason (Evidence).
2026-10-07 T-0032 Standing, from the operator's answer, already in `decisions.md` as the 2026-10-04 T-0032 line, for both parts: the empty-output route, and the reviewer leaving the suite and the gate to the verifier. Later changes follow both.
2026-10-07 T-0032 `EMPTY-OUTPUT` is decided in one place, `run finish`. The workflows no longer send `--status-override KILLED` for an empty return, so `run finish` reads the output file for every run. Rejected: a second override value in the scripts. It would label a run empty even when its output file was written.
2026-10-07 T-0032 The retry is counted inside one workflow run: one re-dispatch, then a park. Rejected: a counter in the store. It would add a ticket field for a case that a human already watches, because a workflow that stops is restarted by hand.
2026-10-07 T-0032 A thrown agent call is not re-dispatched. It carries its own error text, including the error thrown when the turn's token ceiling is spent, so it is the one stop the harness can name.
2026-10-07 T-0032 The last message is kept by a new command, `factory run last-message RUN --text=…`, called only after `run finish` has returned `EMPTY-OUTPUT`. The text is the last 4000 characters, as one shell single-quoted word. Rejected: passing it on every `run finish`, which would put each role's whole output through every clerk command.
2026-10-07 T-0032 A second empty output parks as `EMPTY-OUTPUT from <role>`, in the same form as the other role parks, and lists both runs. The last messages stay in the run directories, not in the reason.
2026-10-07 T-0032 A checker's second empty output parks before any result row is recorded for it. `resolve --redispatch` then re-runs only that checker, because the other checker's passing rows stand. Rejected: an `EMPTY-OUTPUT` result row and a join rule for it, a new row status for the same outcome.
2026-10-07 T-0032 The reviewer's input no longer lists the gate commands. It says that the verifier runs them, as the design's routing table already declares (`docs/design.md:126`).
2026-10-07 T-0032 The `budget kill` join reason is kept for hand-recorded `KILLED` rows. Rejected: renaming it, which would change three existing tests for a case no one reported.
2026-10-07 T-0032 `build.js:137` (the implementer's `budget kill` park) is removed. `run finish` can no longer return `KILLED` to the workflow, so the line would never run.
2026-10-07 T-0033 Protected paths at merge (#57, T-0033): the pinned spec's Risk list is the authorization; an undeclared changed protected path is refused at merge and parks for a ruling; no per-head approval step. All instances.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The critic keeps its minimum check, at least 2 cited paths and 1 acceptance command per review. It gains a cap of at most 2 paths and 1 command for any one claim. Rejected: replacing the minimum with the cap, which would let a critic approve having checked nothing. `docs/principles.md`'s Spiking section states the bound per claim ("Grounding a claim … two paths, one command").
2026-10-08 T-0034 The critic runs no test suite and builds nothing (no clone, worktree or prototype of the change). It runs an acceptance command only as the spec gives it, and picks one that runs no test suite. Standing: a later change to the critic prompt keeps this rule, as principle 2 requires.
2026-10-08 T-0034 A claim the critic could settle only by running a test suite or building the change is a finding for the writer, or a question, and the critic says what it could not check. The finding's severity follows the existing rubric. Rubric item 2 ("NEW items fail today") stays unchanged.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The writer and the critic get the same three reading sentences: batch independent reads and commands, read a line range once grep has found it, and send long output to a scratch file and grep or tail it. Only the writer gets "write the spec in as few writes as you can". The critic writes one verdict and needs no such rule.
2026-10-08 T-0034 No shared preamble line. The rules go only in the two role prompts. Rejected: a preamble line, which would reach every role, including the implementer and verifier, which the request does not cover.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The rules are added as new lines only, so no existing line of either prompt changes. The writer's rule is the last RULES bullet of the documented copy. The critic's rules follow its existing PROCESS line.
2026-10-08 T-0034 `docs/principles.md` records the critic's new rule under principle 2 and corrects principle 2's status line, which says "reader roles run no suites" was done by #41 alone.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The request's acceptance, a replay of 2–3 approved intakes with old and new prompts, is an Operator step. Running it needs live model runs, and judging spec quality side by side is a human call. The scenarios check the text the roles receive.
2026-10-08 T-0035 This change overturns part of a standing decision, one that later tickets must keep, recorded on 2026-10-08 for T-0034, the ticket that applied #73: "The critic runs no test suite and builds nothing ... Standing: a later change to the critic prompt keeps this rule". The no-test-suite half stands. The no-build half and the per-claim cap (T-0034's other 2026-10-08 decision) are removed. Authority: the operator's choice in `.factory/answers/T-0034-acceptance-2026-10-08.md`. Standing: later changes to the critic prompt keep the no-suite rule and do not re-add a per-claim cap or a no-build rule without new evidence.
2026-10-08 T-0035 The critic prompt gains one sentence that allows a small experiment in its scratch directory to confirm a finding. Without it, the kept sentence "A claim you could settle only by ... building the change is a finding" reads as the old ban. The kept sentence still covers building or trying out the change itself, which the request's item C (its `docs/principles.md` change) leaves to the writer or to a spike, a ticket built only to test whether an approach works. Rejected: deleting the kept sentence. The triage role, which sorts a request before the spec writer sees it, asked to keep it, and it still tells the critic what to do with a claim it cannot check.
2026-10-08 T-0035 The no-suite line gains its reason, "the implementer and the verifier run it", as the request's item B (its list of what the critic keeps) gives. `Pick an acceptance command that runs no test suite, and run it as the spec gives it.` and the Turn economy paragraph stay word for word.
2026-10-08 T-0035 The Spiking section records the replay result, as the request's item C asks ("Record the replay result"). The changelog entry records it too.
2026-10-08 T-0035 Of the current-truth requirements that #73 added, four are restated (MODIFIED), because each states the rule being removed or forbids removing a critic line. Other current-truth requirements that check the diff of their own change (for example "The documents record the live-store guard", which expects no prompt copy to change) are left as they are, as #73 left them. Their scenarios describe their own change, not standing behaviour.
2026-10-08 T-0035 "Writer unchanged from #73" is checked as no difference from `05cf8f9` in either writer prompt file, plus the writer's design block equal to its `docs/prompts/` copy. Together these mean the design block is unchanged too.
2026-10-09 T-0036 Triage names the capabilities on a new output line, `Capabilities:`, chosen from a capability index added to its input. A token that names no current-truth capability, such as `none` or `new`, is ignored.
2026-10-09 T-0036 Which capabilities a role receives in full: the names on triage's line, plus each existing capability whose `specs/<name>/spec.md` path appears in the spec the role works from. For the writer that is its previous version on a revision round. For the critic it is the version under review. For the planner it is the approved version, read whole, Evidence included. A writer that opens a capability and cites its path under Evidence therefore hands it to the critic. This keeps the request's rule that the critic sees the writer's list plus whatever the writer opened.
2026-10-09 T-0036 A ticket whose latest finished triage output has no `Capabilities:` line gets today's inputs, the whole of current truth and the whole log. This covers tickets triaged before this change, T-0036 among them. Rejected: sending only the index in that case, which would cut those tickets' inputs with no list to cut by.
2026-10-09 T-0036 An index line for a capability gives its name, its size, the absolute path of its spec and its requirement names. Rejected: the request's "one-sentence purpose", because no capability spec on either store has a purpose paragraph (Evidence).
2026-10-09 T-0036 A decision line goes in full when it is logged against this ticket, or when its text names a capability sent in full as a whole word. The log's other lines are indexed one line per ticket: ticket id, number of decisions, first and last date, and the ticket's title. The index heading gives the command `grep ' <ticket id> ' <absolute path of decisions.md>`. Rejected: one index line per decision, which comes to tens of kilobytes on Nanobot (240 lines, median 278 bytes).
2026-10-09 T-0036 A role opens deferred items by path, with its own file reads or `grep`. No `factory spec show` or `factory decision show` command is added. Rejected: those commands, because a command run from inside a role must clear the live-store fence and find the instance from the role's working directory. A path needs neither, and it is how compose already points at full specs (Evidence).
2026-10-09 T-0036 The instructions live in the index headings. They say the list is complete, that anything in it is opened by its path, and that citing a path hands the capability to the critic. Rejected: editing the writer and critic prompts, which would put the same words in two more protected copies.
2026-10-09 T-0036 A run's `input_sources` lists only the files sent in full. An index adds no source.
2026-10-09 T-0036 The standing 2026-10-04 T-0024 decision says that `decisions.md` "keeps reaching the spec writer, critic and planner". It still does: in full for the lines this ticket touches, and line by line for the rest through the index and its `grep` command.
2026-10-09 T-0036 Acceptance does not hold this change to the request's 40 kB mean and 100 kB maximum. The projection gives a mean of 101 kB and a maximum of 167 kB for the Nanobot store's last ten tickets, and the remainder lies outside this change (Problem, Evidence). The operator steps measure the real figures after the change runs.
2026-10-09 T-0036 The docs use one name for the new index, "capability index".
2026-10-09 T-0037 Decision log in role inputs (#78, T-0037): the spec writer, critic and planner get decisions.md whole; #75's decision filter is removed; any future scoping must not be able to drop a cross-cutting standing decision (see #54).
2026-10-09 T-0037 The spec writer, critic and planner receive `decisions.md` whole whenever it holds any text, whatever capabilities their ticket names. The decision index and its `grep` instruction are removed. This is the operator's Answer 1, already standing in `decisions.md` as the 2026-10-09 T-0037 line. Rejected: the request's rule of sending lines that name no capability in full and filtering the rest. On today's logs it sends every line anyway, and it could still hide a cross-cutting decision that happens to name a capability.
2026-10-09 T-0037 The capability index note loses its clause ", and the decisions that name it to the critic and the planner,"; the rest of the note stays word for word. Rejected: keeping the clause, which would tell the writer that citing a path is how decisions reach the critic and planner. That is no longer so. This edits one sentence of #75's capability half, which the triage assumption kept byte for byte.
2026-10-09 T-0037 The planner's decision part no longer reads triage's capability names or the approved spec's citations. It reads the whole log, as before #75.
2026-10-09 T-0037 The decision part is measured in this spec's Evidence, before and after, on both stores. No new file or harness command records it.
2026-10-09 T-0038 Each sub-ticket records `planned_from`, the parent's approved version when the sub-ticket was created. Nothing changes it afterwards. Rejected: reading `spec.approved_version`, which approved T-0027 moves forward on amendment.
2026-10-09 T-0038 Superseded is computed whenever sub-tickets are read, not stored. A sub-ticket is superseded when it has not merged and its `planned_from` is lower than the highest `planned_from` among its parent's sub-tickets. Rejected: the request's mark written at re-plan time. That needs a write on every path that adds a plan and a migration for stores that already hold such sub-tickets, such as Nanobot T-0024. Also rejected: comparing with the parent's current approved version. That would supersede the live plan after a T-0027 amendment that keeps it.
2026-10-09 T-0038 A record without `planned_from`, or with it null, falls back to its `spec.approved_version`. With neither, the sub-ticket counts as current.
2026-10-09 T-0038 A plan made from the same approved version supersedes nothing. This covers `resolve --replan` after a failed final check, and a second plan added by hand. The design ties a new plan to an amended spec (`docs/design.md:109`). To replace a plan without changing intent, the operator approves with `approve-spec --edit`, which always makes a new version. This is a standing decision.
2026-10-09 T-0038 Merged sub-tickets are never superseded. They count toward the close, the final check must contain their merges, and a new plan may depend on them.
2026-10-09 T-0038 `subticket add` refuses, writing nothing, a plan whose `Depends on:` names a sub-ticket that the plan supersedes. Rejected: accepting it. The dependant would wait forever, because a superseded sub-ticket is never dispatched.
2026-10-09 T-0038 `subticket add` reports the sub-ticket ids it newly supersedes under `superseded` and logs a `subtickets.superseded` event. Nothing is deleted, and every id stays taken.
2026-10-09 T-0038 `ticket ready-implementers` keeps `subtickets` as every sub-ticket id. `build.js` reads an empty list as "planned with none", and `dev/build-harness.spec.md:286` documents it that way. Every other list there leaves superseded sub-tickets out, and the new `superseded` list names them.
2026-10-09 T-0038 The planner is told which sub-tickets its plan will supersede, on one line after the existing list. With none, its input is byte-identical to today.
2026-10-09 T-0038 The name is "superseded", as the request and triage use it, and in the same sense as `results/<head>/superseded-<n>/`: a record kept but no longer counted.
2026-10-09 T-0033 The authorization is the pinned spec's Risk section. The pinned spec is the version the operator approved at the spec gate. For a sub-ticket, that is its parent's approved version (`specs/<parent>/v<approved_version>.md`). A ticket with no parent uses its own approved version. A ticket with no approved spec declares nothing. This is standing for every instance, from the operator's 2026-10-05 answer. It is already the 2026-10-07 T-0033 line in `decisions.md`, the factory's log of standing decisions that later tickets must follow.
2026-10-09 T-0033 The gate reads declarations from one fixed line in the Risk section: `Protected paths: none`, or `Protected paths: ` followed by one or more backticked paths or globs, separated by commas. An optional list marker (`- ` or `* `) may come before it, and an optional full stop after it. Each entry is one path or one glob. A brace list such as `factory/prompts/{a,b}.md` is one literal entry, which git does not expand, so it matches no file and declares nothing. A Risk line in any other shape declares nothing, and so does a line inside a fenced code block. Several such lines declare their union. Standing: specs declare protected paths only this way. Rejected: reading every backticked path in Risk, because today's Risk sections also put the paths they promise not to touch in backticks (Evidence). Rejected: the planner's per-sub-ticket `Protected paths:` field, which an agent writes and no human approves.
2026-10-09 T-0033 A changed path is "protected" when it matches one of the instance's in-repo `protected_paths` globs. It is "declared" when it matches a declared entry. Both matches use git's glob pathspecs (`:(glob)<pattern>`, so `**` crosses directories and `*` does not). This follows the 2026-10-05 T-0028 decision that the harness never adds a glob matcher of its own. Patterns that start with `~` or `/` are skipped.
2026-10-09 T-0033 The changed paths are those of `git diff --name-only --no-renames <integration branch>...<head>`, measured from the merge base; the head is the commit the gate is judging. Once the head contains the integration branch, that is exactly what the merge adds. `--no-renames` lists both sides of a move (Evidence). Rejected: the triage's "parent base". A catch-up run is an implementer run that merges the integration branch into a sub-ticket's branch that has fallen behind. After one, a diff from the parent's base counts other tickets' merged changes against this sub-ticket.
2026-10-09 T-0033 The gate runs this check after the three recorded results and before the containment check and the merge lock. A change that will be refused costs no catch-up run.
2026-10-09 T-0033 A refusal exits 2 and changes no ticket field. It logs one `merge.refused` event with the paths. Its error starts `BLOCKED from merge gate: ` and names each undeclared path, sorted and comma-separated. It names no declared path and uses no backtick, `$` or double quote, because the build workflow passes the reason through a shell command.
2026-10-09 T-0033 The build workflow parks the sub-ticket with that error, verbatim, as the reason. It already does the same for the harness's `BLOCKED from harness:` refusal at run start.
2026-10-09 T-0033 The human answers that park with one of two commands. `resolve --ruling F` sends the change back. It uses the existing BLOCKED route: the sub-ticket returns to its implementer with F in its input, and its round count (the number of fix cycles it may use) is not reset. The new `resolve --accept-paths F` accepts the paths under the approved design. It records F as the sub-ticket's next ruling. It adds the undeclared paths, recomputed on the current head, to a ticket field `accepted_paths`, which the gate treats as declared. It returns the sub-ticket to `checks-in-flight`, the state in which the reviewer and verifier judge it, with its recorded results kept, so the build merges it on its next pass. Rejected: one acceptance per head, because a catch-up run makes a new head and the same paths would park again. Rejected: amending the pinned spec's Risk section, because no command amends a pinned spec yet (T-0027 asks for one). An acceptance adds paths only for that sub-ticket and leaves every other merge condition in force.
2026-10-09 T-0033 `--accept-paths` refuses, with exit 2 and nothing written, on a park whose reason does not start `BLOCKED from merge gate:`. Its error starts `--accept-paths applies to`. It also refuses when the head is not the branch tip, or when no undeclared protected path remains.
2026-10-09 T-0033 A ruling on a park whose reason starts `ESCALATE from reviewer` returns the sub-ticket to `checks-in-flight`, round count unchanged. Its recorded results are set aside as `--redispatch` sets them aside: an APPROVE reviewer result is kept, and a VERIFIED verifier result with a PASS gate result is kept. Every other result moves to `superseded-<n>/`. The reviewer and verifier runs that follow receive the ruling, as they already do (`factory/compose.py` lines 278 and 300). This overturns `docs/design.md` line 109, which sends a reviewer ESCALATE to the implementer with the round count reset. Rejected: that route, because the 2026-10-05 escalation needed no code change. The re-run reviewer can still return REQUEST-CHANGES when a ruling asks for a fix.
2026-10-09 T-0033 Check 6 of the reviewer prompt keeps its first two sentences and adds "for the record" to the list of declared paths. Its last sentence says what the gate does: it merges a declared path with no further approval, and refuses and parks one the approved spec does not declare.
2026-10-09 T-0033 No per-head approval is added for paths that change the factory's own rules (option 3 of the operator's answer). The answer leaves it open for this spec gate. Adding it is a gate edit to this spec (a new lettered part) or a later ticket.
2026-10-09 T-0030 T-0030 (#24 A+C) closed as partly applied: part C merged (T-0030.3); parts A, B and per-role effort moved to #65 (backlog review 2026-10-09). Current truth was not folded for this ticket.
2026-10-09 T-0026 T-0026 (#47) withdrawn: merged into #65 at the backlog review 2026-10-09; the Workflow scripts it would change retire with #65.
2026-10-09 T-0039 All five roles get the critic's form of the paragraph, word for word, as one bullet starting `- Turn economy: `. It carries the three reading rules and the sentence saying why they matter. The spec writer's "as few writes as you can" stays out, as the request says. The writer's "such as a suite run" example also stays out, because the code reviewer must not run the suite. With one text, one check covers all five prompts.
2026-10-09 T-0039 The paragraph goes into each role's own prompt, not into the shared preamble. A preamble line would also reach the spec writer and critic, which already carry the rules, and T-0034 rejected a preamble line for the same reason. The request names the five prompts.
2026-10-09 T-0039 New lines only: no existing line of any prompt changes. Placement: in the implementer and verifier, a RULES bullet directly before the declared-path bullet, so that bullet stays last under RULES where T-0029 put it. In the code reviewer, the last bullet of WHAT YOU RUN, which is about the commands it runs. In the planner and triage, the last RULES bullet. In triage's run copy, that is before the instance-added "Acceptance items" block.
2026-10-09 T-0039 Acceptance checks the text each role receives: all three prompt copies and the composed run prompt. The request's own acceptance, the operator replaying past implementer and verifier runs with old and new prompts, is an Operator step. It needs live model runs and a human judgement of verdict quality (as in T-0034 and T-0029).
2026-10-09 T-0039 `docs/changelog.md` gains entry 64 after entry 63 and before the closing "Declined:" line. The entry cites the #74 replay result as entry 59.
2026-10-09 T-0027 The command is `factory spec amend <parent> --file <F> --reason "<one line>" --intent unchanged|changed`, run by a human. Rejected: the build spec's unbuilt `resolve --amend-spec`. Each `resolve` mode acts on a ticket the pipeline has stopped, and an amendment may be needed while a ticket is `planned` and not stopped.
2026-10-09 T-0027 `--intent` is required. With `unchanged`, the harness checks the claim: the amended version must keep the Problem section, every Decisions line, and each requirement's name, operation and statement (its text before its first scenario), whitespace aside. Scenarios, setup, Evidence, design text and Tests to change may change. Any other difference is refused as a change of intent, naming each one. `--intent changed` is always refused. Rejected: issue #50's critic run on every amendment, which needs a new route from the command to the critic; the mechanical check covers the same three things. Rejected: no flag, which lets a human make an intent change without saying so. This is a standing decision.
2026-10-09 T-0027 A refused change of intent prints a restart note. The note lists each merged sub-ticket with its merge commit, which stays on the integration branch. It lists each unmerged one with its state and branch, which a restart discards. It names both ways to restart. The first re-specs and re-plans: `factory ticket park`, `factory resolve <id> --to spec-gate`, then `factory approve-spec <id> --edit F`, after which the new plan supersedes the unmerged sub-tickets. The second closes the ticket and re-files it: `factory resolve <id> --close` and `factory ticket new`. The factory never restarts by itself. This is a standing decision.
2026-10-09 T-0027 An amendment changes no ticket state. The operator resumes the ticket with the routes that exist. Rejected: an amendment that also moves the ticket, which would duplicate those routes.
2026-10-09 T-0027 `spec amend` refuses while any run is in flight on the parent or one of its sub-tickets. A parked or waiting sub-ticket does not block it. Rejected: refusing while any sub-ticket is unmerged, which would block the motivating case of a sub-ticket parked BLOCKED on a scenario it cannot pass. This is a standing decision.
2026-10-09 T-0027 Human-only means that no workflow script and no role prompt names the command. A role run on the parent or a sub-ticket is in flight while it runs, so the in-flight refusal stops it. There is no identity check, because the harness runs under one identity.
2026-10-09 T-0027 `spec amend` refuses, with exit 2 and nothing written, in these cases: a sub-ticket; a ticket with no approved version; a ticket at `awaiting-spec-gate`, where `approve-spec --edit` is the route; a closed ticket; a reason that is not one non-blank line; and, with a spec store, a ticket whose change folder is gone because it was archived. An amended version must pass the gate's own checks: it is well-formed, and its deltas apply to current truth.
2026-10-09 T-0027 The re-pin keeps the planner's `tasks.md` in the change folder. The rest of the folder is rewritten as the gate writes it.
2026-10-09 T-0027 Each sub-ticket that is neither merged nor closed has its spec record moved to the new version, so later runs record the version they received. Its `planned_from`, the version its plan was made from, does not change, so an amendment never supersedes a plan.
2026-10-09 T-0027 The record is `approvals/<parent>/amendment-<n>.md`, numbered after any amendment file already there. It holds who, when, the reason, `Intent: unchanged`, the old and new version, and one line per scenario that differs: `- changed: <name>`, `- added: <name>` or `- removed: <name>`. It also holds a `- <id> / <title>: merged` line per sub-ticket merged before the amendment, and the unified diff. The log gets a `spec.amended` event. The amendment record is that version's approval record; no gate approval file is written.
2026-10-09 T-0027 Every spec version records the integration branch's head when it was stored, in `specs/<id>/v<n>.yaml`; that covers `spec add`, a gate edit and `spec amend`. Drift is counted from the record of the parent's approved version. Rejected: counting from the pin, because T-0032.1's test arrived between writing and pinning. A version stored before this change has no record, so its sub-tickets get only the sibling rule.
2026-10-09 T-0027 The drift check runs at `run start` of a sub-ticket's implementer, before the sibling-tests check. It runs only while the sub-ticket has no implementer run and no ruling on file. On drift it refuses with exit 2, writes nothing, and gives an error that starts `BLOCKED from harness: spec drift:` and names each finding. The build already parks any `BLOCKED ` refusal with it as the reason. The human then amends the spec, rules, or both, and `resolve --ruling` returns the sub-ticket; the ruling also stops the check from repeating. Rejected: a new SPEC-DRIFT park status, as issue #50 proposed, which needs a new `resolve` route.
2026-10-09 T-0027 Sibling rule: drift when the sub-ticket's Acceptance field names, by id or by plan label, a sibling of the current plan that has not merged and that the sub-ticket does not depend on, directly or through other siblings. Nothing makes such a sibling merge first. This is a standing decision.
2026-10-09 T-0027 Test rule: drift for each test file changed on the integration branch since the version's recorded head, by a first-parent commit that also changed a file the spec's design part names, and that neither the spec's Tests to change nor the sub-ticket's Tests to change lists. A test file's name starts with `test_`, or ends `_test.<ext>`, or contains `.test.`. Named files are the design part's backticked paths that exist at the integration head, except test files and `.md` documents, which every ticket here edits. This approximates "pins behaviour the spec changes": measured above, it catches 9 of 10 known incidents and would park about half the sub-tickets. Rejected: running each NEW scenario at build start and comparing it with the spec's "fails today" output (issue #50, part D). That output is prose, not something a program can compare. Rejected: a judge run per sub-ticket, which needs a new role and route.
2026-10-09 T-0027 The critic's input gains a section, `## Approved changes not yet archived`. It lists each change folder whose ticket is neither closed nor back in the spec loop (`ready-for-spec-writer`, `ready-for-critic`, `awaiting-spec-gate`), other than the reviewed ticket's own. Each entry gives the ticket id, title, state, folder path, the requirements its deltas add, modify or remove, and its Decisions lines. The section reads `none` when the list is empty, and is left out when the store has no spec store. Rejected: whole proposals, which would multiply the critic's input.
2026-10-09 T-0027 The cross-ticket rule extends the critic's rubric item 5 (Consistent). A scenario whose setup would not hold under one of the two merge orders is a BLOCKING finding that names the other ticket and its decision. This is a standing decision.
2026-10-09 T-0031 The wrapper fully deactivates an inherited virtual environment. It removes the exact entry `$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin` from `PATH`, then unsets `VIRTUAL_ENV` and `PYTHONHOME`, all before it sets HOME. Rejected: unsetting only the two variables, as the requester proposed. The activating shell also put the environment's `bin/` first on `PATH`, so a bare `python` or `pytest` would still run the other repository's environment (Evidence).
2026-10-09 T-0031 The deactivation is built into the wrapper for every instance, not configured per instance. Rejected: a way to unset variables through `run_env`. Every instance needs the deactivation, and opting in would leave it off by default. `run_env` is the list of variables an instance gives the wrapper to export after the throwaway HOME. Its exports still come after the deactivation, so an instance that wants a particular environment can still name it there.
2026-10-09 T-0031 `environment_sync` is one optional shell command, given as a string in `instance.yaml`. If it is absent or null, nothing runs, as today. Any other non-string or empty value is refused at run start, before any checkout is made.
2026-10-09 T-0031 The sync runs at every build-role run start, for the implementer, reviewer and verifier, including the verifier that checks the parent ticket after all its sub-tickets merge. It runs in that run's checkout, after the environment files are copied, through the same wrapper as role commands, so it gets the throwaway HOME, the `run_env` exports and no inherited environment. Rejected: syncing only when the implementer's worktree is first created. The environment files are copied again at every run start. A conflict run, which is an implementer run after the merge step refused the branch, merges in the integration branch, the branch that finished tickets merge into. Either can change the lock file the environment was built from. The reviewer is synced too, although it no longer runs the gate commands: its prompt still lets it run one test to confirm a finding (Evidence).
2026-10-09 T-0031 Changed from version 2: a failed sync refuses the run start with exit 2 and a one-line error, `environment_sync failed (exit <code>) in <checkout>; its command and output are in <log>`. The log is `runs/<id>/environment-sync.log`, in the run directory that run start had already reserved. It holds the command, the exit code and the command's full output. The error carries neither the command nor its output. No run is recorded or put in flight, and a checker checkout made for the run is removed. The implementer's worktree is kept for the next dispatch. The build workflow, the script that dispatches the build roles in turn, then parks the ticket: it stops the ticket and leaves it for a human. It uses its existing park reason `harness-bug: run start <role>: …`, so a broken environment never reaches a checker as a code failure. Rejected: version 2's error with the command and its last 20 output lines. The workflow passes the reason to the shell in double quotes, which expand the backticks that uv's errors contain, and the command is the operator's free text (Evidence). Rejected: starting the role anyway with a note. The role would then rediscover the broken environment, which is the cost this change removes.
2026-10-09 T-0031 When the sync ran, the run's record file, `meta.yaml`, stores the command under `environment_sync`. Changed from version 2: the role's input gains one line at the end of its "Where you work" section, after any SKIPPED lines. The line says the command ran, the environment is already synced, and the role should not sync again unless its change alters the files the environment is built from. Rejected: version 2's "after the gate-commands line", which the reviewer's input no longer has (Evidence).
2026-10-09 T-0031 This change sets `environment_sync` on neither instance. The operator sets it after the runtime, the separate checkout the factory runs from, has moved to the new harness revision (Operator steps). Rejected: setting it on this instance in the PR. That writes the protected `.factory/**`, and the key has no effect until the runtime runs the new harness anyway.
2026-10-10 T-0040 The driver is a harness subcommand, `factory drive TICKET [--phase intake|build] [--parallel N] [--prompt-mode append|replace]`, in a new module `factory/drive.py`, run as its own foreground process. A runner session may start it in the background. Rejected: running it inside the Workflow tool, which is the limit this change removes.
2026-10-10 T-0040 Store calls go through the CLI's own entry point, `factory.cli.main(argv)`, in the driver's process, with stdout and stderr captured, one call at a time on the driver's main thread. Every guard, refusal, fence check and lock check runs exactly as for `bin/factory`. Rejected: a `bin/factory` subprocess per call, which the requester ruled out. Rejected: calling store functions below `main`, which would skip the fence and the lock.
2026-10-10 T-0040 `factory drive` is a write command like any other, so the fence and the lock apply when it starts. Under the standing 2026-10-04 T-0024 decision, a runner that starts it while any run is in flight on the target puts `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` in front of it. Once started, the driver marks its own store calls whether or not it was started marked. Its role processes never inherit the marker. Rejected: exempting `drive` from the fence, which would change the current-truth requirement that every unmarked write is refused while a run is in flight.
2026-10-10 T-0040 Each role runs as `claude -p <prompt> --model <models[role]> --output-format json --permission-mode auto --append-system-prompt-file <run>/system-prompt.txt --tools <list> --allowedTools <list>`, plus `--add-dir <worktree>` for the implementer and `--effort <level>` when the instance sets one. The process runs from the run directory with stdin closed. The `-p` prompt is the fixed text that names the run's input and output files and nothing else. That also removes the operator's chat message from every role's task (#28, absorbed).
2026-10-10 T-0040 `--permission-mode auto` with explicit allowlists: the classifier keeps checking each call that no rule allows, as it does for role agents today. Rejected: `dontAsk`. It is strict (Evidence), but it removes the classifier while roles run with no operating-system isolation (#37); operator ruling, 2026-10-09, to revisit once #37 lands. Build spec row R6's "nor `dontAsk`" therefore stays. Rejected: `bypassPermissions`, which R6 rightly forbids.
2026-10-10 T-0040 Tool limits. `--tools` is `Read,Grep,Glob,Bash,Write,WebFetch,WebSearch` for every role, and the implementer's list adds `Edit`. `--allowedTools` is `Read,Grep,Glob,Bash,WebFetch,WebSearch` plus three `Edit` rules on absolute real paths: `Edit(/<run>/output.md)`, `Edit(/<run>/scratch/**)` and `Edit(/<temporary directory>/**)`. The implementer's list adds `Edit(/<worktree>/**)`. The checkers therefore cannot use a file tool on the checkout under their run directory, which is the limit #24 part A wanted, absorbed. Bash stays unrestricted, so these limits cover the file tools only (Risk). Web tools are kept because role agents have them today. Every other tool the session offers today, such as sub-agents, task lists and notebook edits, is withheld: no role prompt in `factory/prompts/` asks for one. Rejected: withholding `Write` from the checkers, who must write `output.md`.
2026-10-10 T-0040 `--append-system-prompt-file` is the default. `--prompt-mode replace` passes `--system-prompt-file` instead, so the operator can measure the difference on a real ticket (Operator step 3). Rejected: deciding by measurement in this spec, which needs real model runs.
2026-10-10 T-0040 No `--bare`: it needs an API key and does not use the operator's subscription.
2026-10-10 T-0040 Effort per role comes from an optional `effort:` map in `instance.yaml`, keyed by role. An absent role gets no `--effort` flag. Values are passed through unchecked: Claude Code rejects a bad value before the run starts, which the driver records as a failed call. Neither instance sets `effort` in this change (Operator step 4). Per-role effort (#22) is absorbed.
2026-10-10 T-0040 A role process's reply is kept whole, as printed, in `runs/<id>/reply.json`. `run finish` gains `--reply FILE`, which records `session_id`, `total_cost_usd`, `num_turns` and `usage` under a `claude:` key in the run's `meta.yaml`. The reply's `result` text is not copied into `meta.yaml`, because it repeats `output.md`. This departs from the request's wording, which listed `result` too.
2026-10-10 T-0040 A failed call is a role process that exits non-zero or prints no JSON object on stdout. It is treated as a thrown `agent()` call is today: `run finish --status-override KILLED`, then a cleanup of a checker's checkout, then a park with `agent call failed: <role>: <message>`, and no retry. The message is the reply's `result` when there is one, else the last non-blank line of stderr, else `exit <code>`. A process that exits 0 with `is_error` set is routed on its output file like any other.
2026-10-10 T-0040 The two checkers run as concurrent processes, and both finish and record their results before the join, as `parallel()` does today. Ready sub-tickets build concurrently up to `--parallel N`, default 2. Rejected: unbounded, as `build.js` runs today, while concurrent `claude -p` processes are untested (Operator step 2).
2026-10-10 T-0040 On SIGINT or SIGTERM the driver sends SIGTERM to each role process it started. It sends SIGKILL to any still running 10 seconds later. It finishes each of its in-flight runs with `--status-override KILLED`, and runs a checker's cleanup. It parks nothing. It writes the stop to its status file, prints `{"ok": false, "ticket": "<id>", "stopped": "SIGINT"|"SIGTERM"}` as its last line and exits with 128 plus the signal number. Running `factory drive` again resumes from the stored state, as re-running a script does today. Rejected: parking on a stop, because a human stop is not a pipeline failure.
2026-10-10 T-0040 Without `--phase`, the phase follows the stored state. `ready-for-triage`, `ready-for-spec-writer` and `ready-for-critic` are intake. `ready-for-planner`, `planned` and `ready-for-parent-verify` are build. Any other state ends at once with "nothing to dispatch", as the scripts do. The driver never crosses the spec gate.
2026-10-10 T-0040 Progress output: one stdout line per step, `<ticket id> "<ticket title>": <step>`, where the ticket is the one the step concerns. A build step on a sub-ticket names the sub-ticket and its title (#47, absorbed). The last stdout line is one JSON object, the result the matching script returns, with `"ok": true` added. The status file is `drive/<parent id>.yaml` in the store, with keys `ticket`, `title`, `phase`, `pid`, `started`, `updated`, `running` (a list of `{run, role, ticket, pid}`), `last` (the last step line) and `ended` (null while running, then the result object). Rejected: changing `ticket show`, which `factory report` (#17) is meant to cover.
2026-10-10 T-0040 The status file is never committed. Part A appends `drive/` to the store's `.gitignore` block, under its own comment line, as `runs/*/tripwire.yaml` is. The file is a live view of one driver process: its `pid`, `updated` time and `running` list change at every step, and what lasts (each run's status, reply and cost, the ticket's state) is already in the run and ticket records. Rejected: committing it, which adds a churning file to every store commit. Rejected: a `drive/.gitignore` that ignores its own directory, which would put a second list of never-committed paths beside the store's block.
2026-10-10 T-0040 The driver has no stub mode. Tests put a stand-in `claude` first on `PATH`. Rejected: porting the scripts' `stubs` argument, whose stub agent needs Claude Code.
2026-10-10 T-0040 Park reasons and log events are the same as the scripts produce, so the parity scenarios compare records byte for byte, apart from ids, times and the order of the two checkers.
2026-10-10 T-0040 Retiring the scripts (the request's part F) is a separate ticket. A sub-ticket of this spec cannot wait for the operator's real runs, so the build would retire the scripts before the driver had run a real ticket.
2026-10-10 T-0040 The suite tests use a Python stand-in `claude`, so the suite needs nothing new. The acceptance scenarios also run the scripts under node, side by side with the driver, as earlier tickets' scenarios do.
2026-10-10 T-0040 The change is NEEDS-SPLIT, in three lettered parts (design.md).
2026-10-11 T-0041 1 (which commits are not drift): the test rule skips a first-parent commit that is the recorded merge (`merge.main_after`) of any merged sub-ticket of the same parent, from the current plan or an earlier one. Rejected: only the current plan's siblings. An earlier plan's merged sub-ticket is also this parent's own work, and the sibling-tests check already counts it the same way.
2026-10-11 T-0041 2 (later commits still count): only the sibling's exact merge commit is skipped, never merge commits in general. A later direct commit or merge from anywhere else that changes a test beside a design-named file is still drift, and the refusal names that commit.
2026-10-11 T-0041 3 (the resolve route): `resolve <id> --ruling F` also accepts a park whose reason starts `harness-bug: run start implementer:` and that was parked from `ready-for-implementer`. It writes F as the next ruling and returns the sub-ticket to `ready-for-implementer` at the same round, as a ruling on a `BLOCKED` park does. As with any ruling on file, the drift check does not run again for that sub-ticket. Rejected: widening `--redispatch` to this park. `--redispatch` re-runs the checkers today, and with no ruling on file a drift refusal would park the sub-ticket again. Rejected: accepting every harness-bug park from `ready-for-implementer`. A failed `run compose` leaves its run in flight, so the next run start would be refused again.
2026-10-11 T-0041 4 (refusal text): `--ruling` on any other park is refused with `--ruling applies to an ESCALATE or BLOCKED park, or a harness-bug park from an implementer's run start; <id> is <state> (<reason or 'no park'>)`, so the operator sees the new case.
2026-10-11 T-0042 The dispatcher (factory drive, and any later runner command) is exempt from the live-store fence's in-flight check, keeps the runs/ and worktrees/ refusal, and carries its own same-ticket guard (refuse while the ticket or a sub-ticket has a run in flight, or a live driver is recorded); overturns T-0040's rejection (operator, 2026-10-11, T-0042)
2026-10-11 T-0042 `factory drive` skips the fence's in-flight rule and keeps its location rule, which refuses a caller under the own store's `runs/` or `worktrees/`, marked or not. This is the operator's answer of 2026-10-11 (option A). It overturns T-0040's 2026-10-10 rejection of exempting `drive`. It is standing for every later runner command: the dispatcher is exempt from the in-flight rule and carries its own same-ticket guard.
2026-10-11 T-0042 `factory drive` given `--accept-harness` is fenced in full, in-flight rule included, because an acceptance rewrites the harness lock. This keeps the standing 2026-10-04 T-0024 rule that any command given `--accept-harness` is a write.
2026-10-11 T-0042 The same-ticket guard refuses `drive T`, with exit 2 and nothing written, in two cases. The first is when T or any of its sub-tickets has a run in flight. The second is when `drive/T.yaml` exists, has no `ended` value, and its `pid` is a live process. These are the operator's terms of 2026-10-11.
2026-10-11 T-0042 The guard runs whether or not the caller carries the marker, and on any store, a throwaway store included. Rejected: applying it only on an own store, as the fence is. The guard protects a ticket's records from two drivers, which matters on any store.
2026-10-11 T-0042 The guard runs inside the `drive` command, after the fence and the harness lock and before the driver sets its marker or writes its status file. A missing ticket skips the guard, so the existing "no such ticket" result is unchanged.
2026-10-11 T-0042 A pid counts as live when signal 0 reaches it, or is refused for permission. A missing, non-integer or dead pid does not block. A dead pid not blocking is the operator's term.
2026-10-11 T-0042 Rejected: checking that a live pid is a `factory drive` process. That would add a platform-dependent process query for a rare case, a pid reused after a SIGKILLed driver. The refusal names the pid and the status file instead, and README tells the operator to delete that file when the pid is not a driver.
2026-10-11 T-0042 The refusals read `<T> has runs in flight on it or its sub-tickets: <run ids>; drive it again once they finish` and `<T> is already being driven by pid <n> (<status file>); stop that driver or wait for it to end`. Neither names the marker, as the standing 2026-10-04 T-0024 decision requires of the fence's refusal.
2026-10-11 T-0042 README's driver step that told the operator to type the marker is removed. In its place README says why the driver needs no marker, and what it refuses instead. This is the operator's direction of 2026-10-11.
2026-10-12 T-0043 The command is `factory stats [--store PATH]... [--since WHEN] [--until WHEN] [--transcripts DIR]...`. - With no `--store`, it reads the store of the instance found from the caller's directory. As other commands do, it honours `FACTORY_STATE`, the environment variable that points a command at another store (tests use it to point at a throwaway one). With neither, it is refused with exit 2. A `--store` path with neither `runs/` nor `log/` is refused with exit 2.
2026-10-12 T-0043 `--until` is added beyond the request, so that a past figure can be reproduced on a store that keeps growing. - WHEN is an ISO date or date-time, taken as UTC when it has no zone. `--since` is inclusive and `--until` exclusive. - Runs are windowed by `started` and events by `ts`. Looking up who wrote and who critiqued a spec ignores the window.
2026-10-12 T-0043 The output is Markdown with fixed section headings and column orders, given in design.md part B. Rejected: JSON (Out of scope).
2026-10-12 T-0043 `stats` is handled like `paths`: no instance needed, no live-store fence (the guard against role runs writing the store), no harness lock check, and `--accept-harness` ignored. - Why: it writes nothing, and it must read a live store while runs are in flight and from a checkout the instance has not accepted, such as a verifier's. - The fence's read-only list in the documents gains `stats`. This follows the standing 2026-10-04 rule that a new command is fenced until it is added to that list. - Rejected: adding it only to `READ_ONLY`, as triage assumed. The lock would still refuse it everywhere but the accepted runtime.
2026-10-12 T-0043 The rows are keyed by role and model, summed over every store given, and ordered triage, spec_writer, critic, planner, implementer, reviewer, verifier, then any other role by name, and models by name within a role.
2026-10-12 T-0043 A row's "runs" counts runs with a verdict other than `KILLED`. `KILLED` runs have their own column, and runs still in flight (status `running` or none) are left out. This is how the request counted (94 reviewer runs plus 5 killed).
2026-10-12 T-0043 A changed outcome is a verdict of `REQUEST-CHANGES`, `ESCALATE`, `FAILED`, `SPEC-DEFECT`, `REVISE` or `BLOCKED`, from any role. This is the request's list.
2026-10-12 T-0043 BLOCKING findings are counted for the reviewer and the critic only. A finding is a line of `output.md` that starts with `[BLOCKING]`, after optional leading spaces and an optional `-`, `*` or `1.` marker, and that does not contain `RESOLVED`. - Rejected: counting every mention of the word, which counts "No BLOCKING findings". - Rejected: counting round-2 restatements of a fixed finding.
2026-10-12 T-0043 Park reasons are normalised by a fixed list in the module, extended when a new reason appears. The steps are: 1. take the first line; 2. replace run ids with `<run>`, ticket ids with `<ticket>`, and 7-to-40-character hex strings that contain a letter with `<sha>`; 3. keep the first two `: `-separated fields; 4. trim, and drop a trailing colon.
2026-10-12 T-0043 A park counts under its corrected reason. A `park.corrected` event replaces the reason of the latest earlier `ticket.parked` event of the same ticket whose reason equals the correction's `previous`. A correction that matches no park changes nothing. - Only corrections dated before `--until` apply, so a past figure stays repeatable after a later correction. The park itself is windowed by its own `ts`. - Why: the operator corrects a reason because the recorded one was wrong, as on T-0040.3, where a refusal was mis-filed as a harness bug. Counting the original would report the error the human fixed. - Rejected: ignoring corrections. Rejected: applying every correction whatever its date, which lets a later correction move a figure quoted for a past cut.
2026-10-12 T-0043 Section B's decision rows are: - `spec approved`: `approval.recorded` events with `kind: spec`; - `spec changes requested`: `human.resolved` events with `kind: request-changes`; - one `resolved: <kind>` row per other `human.resolved` kind; - one `merge refused: <reason>` row per `merge.refused` reason (`head does not contain main` is the conflict case); - `archive refused`: parks whose normalised reason is `archive` or starts with `archive:`.
2026-10-12 T-0043 Section C is built as follows: - Each catch is a verifier run with `SPEC-DEFECT` or an implementer run with `BLOCKED`. - Its spec is the parent ticket's (the ticket id without a trailing `.N`) at the run's `spec_version`. - "Written by" is that version's `spec.added` source when the source is a run id. It is `human` when the source is anything else (a gate edit or an amendment), and `unknown` when the version has no `spec.added` event. - "Critiqued by" is the latest critic run of the parent at that `spec_version`, or `none`. - The REVISE count is all critic REVISE runs of the parent. - A second table splits approved tickets by whether they had a REVISE and counts those with a later catch. This answers the REVISE question with no further tool.
2026-10-12 T-0043 Cost per run comes from the run's cost record (`claude.usage`, `claude.total_cost_usd`) when present, else from its transcript, else nothing. Each row names how many runs used each source. This is the owner's proposal. - Context tokens are input + cache-read + cache-creation tokens, the definition `factory/cost.py` already uses. - Dollars come only from cost records, because transcripts carry none. - Killed runs count, because they spent tokens.
2026-10-12 T-0043 Transcripts are searched only under the `--transcripts` directories, for every `*.jsonl` file at any depth. - Rejected: searching `~/.claude/projects` by default. That ties the command to one machine's layout and costs about 12 seconds on every call.
2026-10-12 T-0043 A transcript is matched to a run R of a store S as follows: - Its first user message that names a run directory, `<P>/runs/<R>/`, gives the candidate. A user message is skipped when it starts with `[Workflow harness — user request]`, which relays the operator's words. - The transcript's first timestamp must lie between R's `started` and `finished`. - A P that is the path of another store given on the command line rules the transcript out. - A candidate whose P is S's path, or S's path before a `store.migrated` event, wins. Otherwise a single remaining candidate is taken. Otherwise there is none. - Rejected: requiring S's path. That loses every run from before an unrecorded move (this store's first 103).
2026-10-12 T-0043 Usage counts each message id once, taking its last record. A record with no id counts alone. The `calls` column of `factory/cost.py` then counts message ids. This fix applies to `factory/cost.py` itself and absorbs issue #61, the report of the double count.
2026-10-12 T-0043 Implementer gate failures fixed before hand-off are read from the transcript. - The gate commands are the backticked commands on the "Gate commands" line of the run's `input.md`. Each is matched by its own text: what follows the wrapper's last `; `, with the closing `)` removed. - A gate counts once per run when a Bash call containing it returned an error (`is_error: true`) and a later call returned none. - A run with no transcript or no gate line is "not recorded", not zero. - Rejected: the implementer's output, which states only the final results. - The text match can miss a command the implementer ran in another form. That is a known limit, stated in README.
2026-10-12 T-0043 `docs/design.md`'s model-per-role paragraph cites `factory stats` and the reviewer, critic, verifier and implementer figures from sections A and D, for `--until 2026-10-07T12:00` with `--transcripts`. This is part E of the request. Its retro half moves to the retro's own issue, #42 (Out of scope).
2026-10-12 T-0043 `docs/principles.md` §4 gets the command's figure, 3 BLOCKING findings, in place of 1 (Evidence), and its "Implemented by" line names `factory stats`.
2026-10-12 T-0044 Every change must add or change at least one requirement in the spec store, the folder of requirement files that says what the harness does. That folder holds one file per capability, a named area of behaviour. For example, build-dispatch covers how role runs are started and routed. The store refuses a change with no such addition (`factory/specstore.py:202`: "no delta part"). Triage, the first role, which accepts the request, named no capability, because nothing here changes behaviour. This change therefore adds a new capability, `harness-code`, to hold the checks that the removed code stays gone. It also adds to build-dispatch one requirement that pins the in-flight refusal this change merges, since no existing requirement covers it. Rejected: putting the removal checks in build-dispatch, which describes how runs are started, not what the source contains.
2026-10-12 T-0044 `gitops.repo_root` keeps its name and loses its parameter. All 12 callers become `gitops.repo_root()`. Rejected: deleting the wrapper and calling `instance.repo_root()`, which would also move imports in `compose.py` and `gitops.py` for no gain.
2026-10-12 T-0044 Of the two writes of the store's `.gitignore` block when a build role starts, the one inside the build-role setup function `_start_build_run` (`cli.py:377`) goes. The call at `:229` covers every role. Rejected: removing `:229`, which would leave triage, spec writer, critic and planner runs without the write.
2026-10-12 T-0044 The two in-flight refusals become one condition over the five roles, written as an explicit list: `("triage", "spec_writer", "critic", "planner", "implementer")`. Rejected: `a.role not in ("reviewer", "verifier")`, which would silently cover a role added later.
2026-10-12 T-0044 The refusal in compose, the step that writes a run's input file, keeps its place at `compose.py:420` and changes its text to `compose: unknown role {role}`. Rejected: deleting that branch, because a hand-edited run record would then get an empty input and no error.
2026-10-12 T-0044 The store module's docstring keeps only its first line. Rejected: keeping "Every write goes through here", a claim this ticket did not verify.
2026-10-12 T-0044 The design documents that still describe `force_push_allowed` stay as they are, and the gap is recorded here. Changing `docs/design.md` would need a changelog entry and a re-copied `docs/prompts/05-implementer.md`, and prompts are out of this round. In practice the setting has done nothing since the shipped prompt hardcoded "never rebase".
2026-10-12 T-0044 A change to factory/**, bin/factory, agents/**, pyproject.toml or uv.lock touches the protected class harness and must declare it on the spec's Protected paths line; T-0044 wrote 'none' and its merge was refused (operator accepted with resolve --accept-paths, 2026-10-11)
2026-10-12 T-0045 Test files never import from another test file. Shared code lives in two non-test modules. `tests/factory/_cli.py` holds the generic helpers: constants, wrappers, the JSON readers, the ticket reader and the two setups. `tests/factory/_fixtures.py` holds the scenario fixtures that more than one test file uses. Standing: a later ticket that needs a helper in a second file moves it to one of these two modules. Rejected: one module for everything, which would put the 190-line fixture in `test_shepherd.py` that drives a ticket through a whole build beside eight-line wrappers. Also rejected: `conftest.py` fixtures, whose names apply to every file, while four files define their own `target`.
2026-10-12 T-0045 The JSON reader comes in two forms. `js` only parses. `js_ok` asserts exit 0 and then parses. Each file imports the form its own copy had, under the name `js`, so no call site changes and the exit check stays opt-in per caller. Rejected: a `check=` argument at each call, which touches every call site.
2026-10-12 T-0045 `conftest.py` sets both `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` in the environment and `sys.dont_write_bytecode = True`. Rejected: adding `env=` at each Python start, the request's suggestion. It misses the two in-process loads, as the prototype showed.
2026-10-12 T-0045 The check that nothing is written into the checkout leaves out `tests/factory/__pycache__`. pytest writes two files there before `conftest.py` can act. Only the person running pytest can stop that.
2026-10-12 T-0045 The removed test is `test_p0_cli.py`'s KILLED-override test. The test in `test_empty_output.py` keeps all three of its checks.
2026-10-12 T-0045 The approved-parent helper takes a caller's `ok` function, the ticket id and a spec file. It runs the five calls and returns the ticket id. Ticket creation stays with the caller. Sites that use `spec add --from-run`, assert a step, or put other work between steps keep their own calls. Cut: the request's `plan` argument. A plan is not part of the repeated five calls.
2026-10-12 T-0045 The class-level `cli`/`ok` pair comes from one base class. Each class still builds its own environment, so the instance copy, the venv and the PATH stand-in stay where they are. A class whose `cli` differs overrides `cli` only.
2026-10-12 T-0045 The acceptance checks name helper names (`REPO`, `js`, and so on) and the one test this change removes. The subject of this ticket is the suite's own structure, so those names are the behaviour being checked.
2026-10-12 T-0045 Changed in round 2: the checks that compare with a base compare across each of this ticket's own merges into `main` (each `Merge factory/T-0045.<n>` commit against its first parent), plus the unmerged commits of the checked-out branch (`git merge-base HEAD main` against `HEAD`), and add up the results. Other tickets' changes to the same files are therefore never counted, whichever order they merge in. Rejected: v1's single base, the commit before this ticket's first merge, which counts T-0044's two assertion changes if T-0044 merges in between (critic, round 1). Rejected: the critic's suggested THEN with a second outcome when T-0044 has merged. Three more de-bloat tickets in the same sweep (T-0046, T-0047, T-0048) edit the same files and would each need a clause of their own.
2026-10-12 T-0046 The shared run lister skips a run whose record file is empty, as the scratch clean-up does today. (The record file is `meta.yaml`, which each run's directory holds; the clean-up is `clear_scratch`, the function that deletes finished runs' scratch directories.) The other three callers would otherwise crash with `AttributeError` if they read the record while a run started in parallel is still writing it. This is the one difference from today's behaviour, and it can happen only during that write. Rejected: an iterator that hands back an empty meta for each caller to handle, which would leave the ticket, role and finished filters copied at every caller.
2026-10-12 T-0046 The event log gets two readers. `store.log_lines` yields raw lines and leaves malformed-line handling to the caller, so `factory log tail` still prints raw text and the command-line readers still raise on a line that is not JSON. A new `cost._log_records` keeps the cost report's skip-malformed behaviour and is shared with the stats report (`stats.py`). `cost.py` stays free of imports from the `factory` package, as the request allows, because a test (`test_cost_once.py`) loads it by file path. Rejected: one strict reader for all four callers, which would change what `factory stats` does with a malformed line.
2026-10-12 T-0046 The dispatcher's shared piece is a function that formats the park reason, not one that parks. Three of the 18 sites pick their reason inside a conditional expression (`drive.py:192`, `453`, `517`), and a helper cannot `return` from its caller. It is named `_harness_bug` so that it is not confused with `drive.py`'s existing `_fail` (`drive.py:664`), which prints a failure and exits.
2026-10-12 T-0046 Part H of v2, one walker for spec sections and heading blocks, is cut (operator, spec gate, 2026-10-12): the most risk for the least saving. The spec-parser comparison stays as a REGRESSION check, because part A changes `specstore.critic_rounds`.
2026-10-12 T-0046 The helpers' names and modules follow the request where it gave them (`store.record_transition`, `store.in_flight_runs`, a gitops helper, `section(text, heading)`). Where it did not, design.md names them.
2026-10-12 T-0047 1. The command-line code becomes six modules. `factory/cli.py` keeps the parser, the entry point, the role lists and the ticket, run, spec and plan commands. The five new modules are: - `factory/drift.py` for the spec-drift checks; - `factory/setup.py` for `init`, `store migrate` and `paths`; - `factory/gates.py` for results, the merge gate, join, the parent check and archive; - `factory/human.py` for `approve-spec`, `request-changes`, `resolve`, `decision add` and `spec amend`; - `factory/common.py` for the helpers more than one module calls, and the live-store fence. The fence refuses a write to the live store from inside a role run. The names follow the request. `setup.py` is kept because no build tool reads it (Evidence).
2026-10-12 T-0047 2. `fence` and `_in_flight` go to `factory/common.py`. Rejected: `factory/instance.py`, where the body of `fence` would change (Evidence). Also rejected: a sixth module, which would add a header for two functions.
2026-10-12 T-0047 3. `ticket_head` goes to `factory/gates.py`. It reports the commit that the checkers review and verify, and the gates record their results against that commit. Without it, `factory/cli.py` ends at about 906 lines (Evidence).
2026-10-12 T-0047 4. `stats_cmd` stays in `factory/cli.py`, where its comment about `ROLES` is true. `paths_cmd` moves to `setup.py`, as the request asks.
2026-10-12 T-0047 5. Each module imports what it uses by name, for example `from factory.common import _rel, out`. No function body changes, so a moved function reads exactly as it did. Rejected: importing the module and qualifying each call, such as `common.out(...)`, which edits nearly every body. Underscored names keep their underscore when another module imports them.
2026-10-12 T-0047 6. `factory/setup.py` uses `import shutil` and keeps calling `shutil.copy2` through the module. The test that replaces `shutil.copy2` therefore still reaches the moved code.
2026-10-12 T-0047 7. The rule that a move is not a rewrite is checked by machine. Across this change, every top-level function, class and assignment of `factory/*.py` must keep its exact source text. The comparison covers each of this ticket's merges and the checked-out branch, as T-0045's suite checks do. Other tickets' changes are therefore never counted.
2026-10-12 T-0047 8. The request's "within ±50 total Python lines" becomes "at most 100 lines added". The prototype, with one-line docstrings, added 60 lines: five module headers of imports, less the imports `factory/cli.py` no longer needs. With rule 7 in place, the line bound only limits header growth. Rejected: ±50, which would push the implementer to cut docstrings.
2026-10-12 T-0047 9. Acceptance names modules, functions and constants. The subject of this ticket is where code lives, so those names are the behaviour checked. T-0045 decided the same for the test suite's helpers.
2026-10-12 T-0047 10. The six harness-code checks that count text in `factory/cli.py` now count it across `factory/cli.py` and the five new modules (Evidence). The expected numbers do not change. Rejected: leaving them, which fails three and empties three.
2026-10-12 T-0047 11. Docs: `README.md:1171` and `docs/principles.md:106-107` name `factory/gates.py` for the moved gate commands. The README status date moves to the day of the change, as "Maintaining this page" asks. Every other doc line that names `factory/cli.py` stays true and is left alone.
2026-10-12 T-0047 12. Standing: no harness module imports `factory.cli` except the entry point (`__main__.py`), the driver (`drive.py`) and the stats report (`stats.py`). A command that a new module needs comes from that module's own imports. This states the request's rule with the third importer, which the request left out.
2026-10-13 T-0050 The instance file is the only source of a role's model. `run start` records `models[role]` from the instance, and `--model` serves only as a cross-check. This is a standing decision: a later caller, including whatever replaces the Workflow scripts, gets its model from `run start` and never chooses one.
2026-10-13 T-0050 A `--model` that differs from the instance's model is refused with exit 2, before a run id is reserved, so nothing is written. The error reads exactly `model <given> refused for <role>: the instance names <instance model>`. It contains no backtick, `$` or double quote, because the build script passes a park reason through a shell command. Leaving out `--model` is still accepted.
2026-10-13 T-0050 The requester's part B is cut: the scripts do not switch to launching on the model `run start` returns. That value also reaches the script through the clerk's report, so launching on it would trust a second relay. Today the scripts launch on the same value they sent as `--model`. With part A, `run start` accepts that value only when it is the instance's model. Rejected: launching on the returned model, which adds a relay. Rejected: comparing the returned model with the sent one, which guards a failure the evidence does not show (the clerk changing the command it runs).
2026-10-13 T-0050 When the clerk misrelays a model, the Workflow run parks the ticket at that role's run start, with reason `harness-bug: run start <role>: <the refusal>`. The run does not go ahead on the instance's model. Rejected: having the scripts stop sending `--model`. `run start` would then pick the right model, but the agent would still be launched on the misrelayed one.
2026-10-13 T-0050 The requester's part C (a test) is kept as a new suite test file for `run start`. The two Workflow routes are checked by acceptance scenarios that run the scripts under node, as the standing T-0023 decision does for workflow fixes.
2026-10-13 T-0051 Part A runs the suite with pytest-xdist alone (`-n auto`): 66.80 to 146.81 s per run, and under 170 s for two at once. Rejected: calling the CLI in-process, alone (113 to 117 s) or with pytest-xdist (27 to 31 s). The test package's name shadows the harness package, so it needs a swap of the module table around every call, or a `tests/__init__.py` that writes into the checkout. It would also stop about 5,400 CLI calls per run from crossing a real process boundary. The parallel run alone meets the target with margin.
2026-10-13 T-0051 pytest-xdist is switched on once, in `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.pytest.ini_options] addopts = "-n auto"`). So the gate command, the README's suite command and every current-truth scenario that runs the suite use it with no text change. That is Part B. Rejected: adding `-n auto` to `gate_commands`, which changes an infra path and leaves every scenario command running sequentially.
2026-10-13 T-0051 Standing, for later tickets: the harness suite runs in parallel worker processes. A new test must not depend on test order. It must not share a file, port, environment variable or other process-wide state with another test, outside its own `tmp_path`.
2026-10-13 T-0051 The suite gains a dev dependency, pytest-xdist, which `uv run --frozen` installs from the lock. This is a deliberate exception to the 2026-10-04 T-0023 decision, "the suite does not need node today and adding that would change what the gate needs", and the request asks for it.
2026-10-13 T-0051 The flaky test is fixed at its measured cause: a file lock around both stand-ins' call counter. Its 2-second sleeps stay. Rejected: the triage's reading, that the sleeps should become a condition the test waits on. No failure of that kind was seen, though one stressed failure has no kept output (Evidence).
2026-10-13 T-0051 The time bounds are under 180 s for one run, from the request's target of 3 minutes, and under 300 s for each of two runs at once. Measured: 66.80 to 146.81 s, and 162.35 to 169.66 s.
2026-10-13 T-0051 `run last-message` alone decides whether a run was waiting, from the text it keeps, and prints `"waiting": true` or `false`. The driver and both scripts read that field. Rejected: a pattern in each of the three callers, three definitions of one rule. Also rejected: a separate command, one more store call per empty run.
2026-10-13 T-0051 A kept message counts as waiting when, ignoring case, it contains the word `wait` or `waiting`, or `still running`, `still in progress` or `in the background`. It is a hint, not a route: a wrong match only adds a misleading phrase to a park a human reads anyway.
2026-10-13 T-0051 The park reason is `EMPTY-OUTPUT from <role>: ended its turn waiting on a background command` when either of the two runs was waiting, and `EMPTY-OUTPUT from <role>` otherwise. The prefix is kept so that anything that reads the reason's start reads it as before. A failed `run last-message` call counts as not waiting.
2026-10-13 T-0051 The README's "Empty output" entry stops saying that it has not fired on a real ticket. It fired on T-0047.2.
2026-10-13 T-0048 Part A freezes the three `dev/` build documents in place, with a header at line 3. Rejected: moving them to `dev/archive/`, which breaks the `Parent:` links in the plan and skeleton and every path cited in `decisions.md`, `dev/issues.md` and past answers.
2026-10-13 T-0048 Standing: a frozen document is never edited again. Current truth checks that each one equals its text at `7231670` apart from the header.
2026-10-13 T-0048 Part B keeps the tested-but-unfired features in the Built list and changes README's rule instead. The rule now says an entry appears once a feature is built and tested, and says whether it has run on a real ticket. Rejected: moving the three that are still unfired (tripwire, sibling-tests check, the drift check's sibling-merge exception) under "Where this can go". They are built, and that section is for intended work.
2026-10-13 T-0048 The protected-path refusal is corrected to "has fired", against the request's "still true and kept". The log shows the refusal on T-0044.1 and the operator's `--accept-paths`.
2026-10-13 T-0048 `docs/design.md:3` drops its date and points to the changelog, which dates every change. Rejected: bumping the date, which every later design change would also have to do.
2026-10-13 T-0048 Part C homes: - The live-store fence lives under "Where a human decides". - The driver's own same-ticket guard lives in its how-to. The request asked to cut that paragraph to one line, but no other section describes the guard, so the paragraph keeps the guard and drops only the fence detail. - The final check's skip lives in "The build workflow, step by step". - The store branch lives in "How the factory uses git". - Other agent hosts live only in `docs/design.md`.
2026-10-13 T-0048 "Not built" and "Where this can go": - "Where this can go" keeps the named intended work. - "Not built" becomes one paragraph of today's facts, with no bullet that repeats one there. - The bold name "Current truth for the factory itself" moves to "Where this can go", because current truth checks for that phrase.
2026-10-13 T-0048 History moves to one new changelog entry, 72, for issue #101. "Related work and history" keeps every issue reference, as #23 asks. It also keeps its last sentence of current figures (tickets, sub-tickets, runtime commit), which the change re-derives.
2026-10-13 T-0048 Standing, for the operator to confirm or strike at the gate: README gets a line budget of 1,110. A later change that needs more room raises it in its own spec. The request asked for a drop of at least 150 lines, but honest one-home cuts give about 90 (prototype: 1,101 lines). The budget is set at that result, with 9 lines of slack, rather than padding the cuts to reach 150.
2026-10-13 T-0048 Part F rules, standing for later `harness-docs` scenarios: - A scenario finds a changelog entry by the words it opens with, "`<n>. After issue #<k> `", and checks that exactly one entry matches. It never uses the last line or an entry count. - A scenario does not check what one change left untouched against `main` or a fixed commit. The two requirements made only of such checks are removed. - Whitespace is checked once, over the maintained documents in full. The instance's gate command `git diff --check main...HEAD` (`.factory/instance.yaml:23`) still checks each change. - The `fill=` comparisons with `main` stay. They hold on every change that keeps the placeholders filled in the run copies, and a change to those is a change to the prompts. - Each check of the frozen build spec is dropped, with the clause that required it. - Principle 2's status clause is dropped, because the principle no longer has a status line.
2026-10-13 T-0048 One sub-ticket. The prototype's diff is 331 lines, under the 400-line bound, and every part edits README, so parallel sub-tickets would collide. The spec names no seams, so the harness builds it whole. Rejected: the request's suggested split into A+F, B+E, C and D.
2026-10-13 T-0053 This repo is public: no new file, spec or role output names the private port's product, its people or its data; the Nanobot fork's existing branch names and checkout paths stay until #111 finds a scrub that breaks nothing (operator, 2026-10-13)
2026-10-13 T-0053 The README pointer replaces the `docs/writing.md` row of "Where things live" with one row naming both files, so README does not grow. Rejected: a new row, which fits today (1,107 lines) but not once T-0052 uses its four lines. Rejected: asking the operator to raise the 1,110 budget, which a zero-growth row makes unnecessary.
2026-10-13 T-0053 The title line stays `# Writing and design standards`, as in the appendix.
2026-10-13 T-0053 The new requirement fixes the text after the title by its SHA-256. A later edit to `docs/standards.md` modifies that requirement in its own spec, where the operator approves the new text. Rejected: checking only that the file exists, which would not hold the operator's "exactly the text".
2026-10-13 T-0053 Standing: no role prompt, `docs/writing.md`, `agents/` or `factory/` file names `docs/standards.md` until a spec that changes prompts says so. Its requirement is the record.
2026-10-13 T-0053 The north-star sentence uses the operator's example wording verbatim.
2026-10-13 T-0053 The changelog entry takes the next free number, whichever of T-0052, #109 or this ticket merges first.
2026-10-14 T-0052 The four descriptions are wrapped in double quotes with their words unchanged. Rejected: rephrasing them without `: `, which changes what each agent's description says.
2026-10-14 T-0052 The suite test checks every `agents/*.md`, one case per template, and each failure names its template. It requires a parseable header that is a mapping with `name`, `description`, `model` and `tools`.
2026-10-14 T-0052 `factory init` reports an existing copy that differs from its template in a new JSON field, `stale_agents` (each copy's path, as `agents` gives created copies' paths), and with one stderr line per copy naming the copy and its template. The exit stays 0 and the copy is left byte for byte as it was. Rejected: overwriting it, which would discard an operator's deliberate edit. Rejected: refusing with exit 2, because a stale copy does not stop a run that uses `inlineRoles`.
2026-10-14 T-0052 "Differs" means any byte difference. A copy the operator edited on purpose is reported too: that is a report, not a refusal.
2026-10-14 T-0052 The comparison runs only where init installs copies: for the target's own store (the directory under the target's `.factory/` that holds the factory's tickets and run records). An init pointed at another store by the `FACTORY_STATE` environment variable, as the tests do with a throwaway store, does not read `.claude/agents/`, and its `stale_agents` is `[]`.
2026-10-14 T-0052 A run of init that only reports differing copies writes no `store.initialised` log event and prints no "restart the session" line, because it wrote nothing.
2026-10-14 T-0052 Standing rule for later tickets: `factory init` never overwrites a target's existing agent copy; it reports one that differs from its template.
2026-10-19 T-0054 1. The command is `factory launch-script intake|build`, and what it writes is a launch copy. Each call writes `<name>.js` into a new directory `factory-launch-<random>` under the temporary directory and prints `{"ok": true, "script": <path>, "source", "harness_revision", "instance"}`. Rejected: a fixed path under the instance's `.factory/`. A later launch would rewrite a script a running workflow came from. A run against a throwaway store would also write into the live instance's directory, which here is a protected path: one the instance lists as needing the operator's acceptance before any ticket may change it.
2026-10-19 T-0054 2. A launch copy differs from its script in one line. The scripts gain the line `const LAUNCH = null`. The copy holds `const LAUNCH = {...}` instead: one JSON object with `written_by: "factory launch-script"`, the source path, the harness revision, the instance, and `models`, `max_rounds` and `state_dir` as `factory config` prints them. The file is read-only. This answers the request's Risk. A launch copy is told apart from an edited script because the harness command alone writes it, into a directory the command creates. It is a one-line change to the reviewed script, and that line names the command, the source and the revision.
2026-10-19 T-0054 3. A launch copy asks no clerk for the configuration. It uses `LAUNCH` as the reply `factory config` would give, so the clerk's own model comes from the instance too.
2026-10-19 T-0054 4. `launch-script` refuses exactly where `config` refuses: with no instance, with uncommitted harness edits, or when the instance has not accepted the running harness revision. To get that, it joins the read-only list of the live-store fence, the harness's refusal of store writes that lack the dispatcher's marker while a role run is in flight. It writes no store file. This modifies live-store-guard's first requirement. Rejected: fencing it as a write, which would refuse a launch while another ticket's run is in flight, where `config` stays open.
2026-10-19 T-0054 5. A launch copy sends every store command to the instance it records. Given an `instance` argument that names another instance, it returns an error naming its own before any store command runs. The copy's models and store path belong to its instance. Mixed with another, agents would read one store's runs while the clerk writes another's.
2026-10-19 T-0054 6. The scripts launched as they are keep their clerk path, and README tells the operator to launch the copy. This keeps every scenario and suite test that runs the scripts directly, and T-0050's park as the backstop. Rejected: a script that refuses to run without a copy, which breaks those checks and would need a test-only switch.
2026-10-19 T-0054 7. `clerk()` in both scripts first parses the whole trimmed stdout, then falls back to the last-line scan. Every rule after the parse is unchanged.
2026-10-19 T-0054 8. The resume command is `factory resolve <id> --to checks`. It accepts a sub-ticket that meets four conditions: it is parked; it was parked from `ready-for-implementer`; its reason starts `harness-bug:`; and its newest implementer run started after it last entered `ready-for-implementer` and finished `READY-FOR-REVIEW`. The event log's order decides "after", because the store's timestamps are whole seconds.
2026-10-19 T-0054 9. The route reads the branch tip as `ticket head` does, through one shared definition. It applies the round step the build applies on this move (`pr:init`): a first round's 0 becomes 1, and a later round is unchanged. That is "round unchanged, as the script would have", and it is what the operator ran by hand for #112. It records a `resolve-<n>.yaml` and a `human.resolved` event of kind `to-checks`.
2026-10-19 T-0054 10. Only `harness-bug:` parks qualify, the class #112 belongs to: a store command failed after the implementer finished. A tripwire park and the conflict-limit park keep their documented routes.
2026-10-19 T-0054 11. A head from a conflict run that did not merge the integration branch still moves to checks. The join then sends it back to its implementer as a conflict (`factory/gates.py:203-206`), as it does after the script's own move.
2026-10-19 T-0054 12. The new tests run the scripts under node inside the suite, as `tests/factory/_fixtures.py`'s `BUILD_DRIVER` already does. T-0023's "the suite does not need node" no longer holds.
2026-10-19 T-0054 13. README keeps its 1,110-line budget. Part F names the lines each edit replaces, and its edits together add at most one line, so README ends at 1,109 lines or fewer. Rejected: raising the budget, which nothing here needs.
2026-10-19 T-0054 14. The changelog entry takes the next free number and opens `<n>. After issue #109 `.
2026-10-19 T-0054 15. Each `launch-script` call first removes earlier launch copies: every `factory-launch-*` directory under the temporary directory that is more than one hour old (by its modification time) and holds exactly one file, `intake.js` or `build.js`, containing `"written_by": "factory launch-script"`. It removes nothing else. The Workflow tool keeps its own copy of a script once launched, so an old launch copy is no longer read (operator, at the gate). Rejected: removing every earlier copy, because another session sharing the temporary directory may have written one seconds before its own Workflow call; and leaving them for the system to clear.
2026-10-19 T-0049 One new diagram, in a new subsection "How a spec changes and feeds later tickets" placed directly after the first diagram of "How a ticket moves", before "Ticket states". Rejected: two diagrams, because the second repeats the three colour lines and the gate node and adds no route.
2026-10-19 T-0049 README's line budget rises from 1,110 to 1,185 lines: the prototype's 1,173 lines plus 12 lines of slack. The operator approves the figure at this gate. A later change that needs more room still raises it in its own spec.
2026-10-19 T-0049 The decision log is drawn with all three of its writers, so the diagram does not imply that `archive` is the only one.
2026-10-19 T-0049 The planner's input edge carries the decision log only, as `factory/compose.py:325` does. This corrects the request, which said the planner also reads current truth.
2026-10-19 T-0049 The acceptance check of the diagrams is structural: balanced quotes and brackets, an opening `flowchart LR` and a closed fence. Rejected: running `npx -y @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`, which needs a network install and a browser download. The spec writer's parse of the prototype is recorded under Evidence, and the operator step below checks the rendering.
2026-10-19 T-0049 The "How a ticket moves" row of "Regenerating this page from scratch" names the modules the new diagram is drawn from, so a rebuild of the page can redraw it.
2026-10-19 T-0049 No changelog entry. `docs/changelog.md` records changes to `docs/design.md`, which this change leaves alone.
2026-10-19 T-0049 One "parked ticket" node stands for both a parked sub-ticket and a parked parent. Each edge label names the command that applies.
2026-10-20 T-0056 T-0056 (#117): a target change is decided by instance; an instance whose target is the factory itself counts its merges as factory work, on a line of their own (operator, 2026-10-19)
2026-10-20 T-0057 T-0057 (#105): a form error the harness can detect goes back to the role that produced it as a new round, and does not park (Green for the operator, 2026-10-20; the operator may strike it at the gate)
2026-10-20 T-0055 T-0055 (#116): until the store records operator time, the scorecard counts operator decisions and interventions per change in place of hours (operator, 2026-10-19)
2026-10-23 T-0058 #88 is fixed in the parser. Before rule (b) is applied, the trailer parser, `parse()` in `factory/status.py`, drops each line below the ESCALATIONS line that, after its list marker is stripped, is exactly `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](<link>)`, with any link and nothing else on the line. Rule (b) applies unchanged to the lines that are left.
2026-10-23 T-0058 Rejected for #88: passing `attribution.pr` through `--settings` to the role processes that `factory drive` (the command that runs each role as a headless `claude -p` process) starts. The key exists, but its effect on a `claude -p` reply is unverified. The footer appeared in 2 of 990 runs, so no acceptance check could show the setting works. It would also not cover the Workflow-script path (the older way of running the roles, beside the drive), which goes through the same parser.
2026-10-23 T-0058 Rejected for #88: ignoring everything after a blank line below the trailer. That would break rule (b) for real items separated by blank lines.
2026-10-23 T-0058 Standing decision for later tickets: the trailer parser drops only the exact Claude Code attribution footer. Any other text below the ESCALATIONS line stays an item under rule (b). Recognising a new footer form needs its own ticket.
2026-10-23 T-0058 #113 changes only the two patterns of that one `case`, to `($T/tmp/factory-launch-*/$s.js)` and `(*)`. The rest of the requirement is restated word for word. This is a spec delta, so current truth changes when the ticket is archived.
2026-10-23 T-0058 #114: an existing copy whose read raises any `OSError` is listed under `stale_agents` by its path, as a differing copy is. Stderr gets one line that names the copy and says it `could not be read`, with the error. Init exits 0 and leaves the copy as it is. The JSON shape does not change, which keeps T-0052's decision that `stale_agents` is a list of paths.
2026-10-23 T-0058 #115: `factory --accept-harness <sha>` with `init`, `paths` or `stats` is refused with exit 2 before anything else runs, on any store, whether or not a run is in flight, and writes nothing. The message names the command and gives `factory --accept-harness <sha> config`, with the sha the operator passed, as the command to run instead. `config` reads nothing it could break and reaches the lock.
2026-10-23 T-0058 That overturns the 2026-10-12 T-0043 decision that `stats` ignores `--accept-harness`, and the same behaviour in `init` and `paths`. Standing decision for later tickets: a command that skips the harness lock refuses `--accept-harness` and never ignores it.
2026-10-23 T-0058 README's "Upgrading the runtime" step 2 names `factory --accept-harness <sha> config` as the command to run. It no longer says "any store command", which would now include three that refuse the flag.
2026-10-23 T-0055 Operator decisions and interventions per change stand in for hours of operator attention until the store records operator time, and the north star says so. This is the operator's answer (a) to round-1 question 1, which asked how an hour of operator attention is counted. Standing: T-0056, the ticket that adds the scorecard to `factory stats` (#117), follows it. `factory stats` is the harness's read-only report on what each run did and cost.
2026-10-23 T-0055 Each instance decides whether its merges are target changes. The Nanobot port's are. Spec-factory's are factory work, reported on a line of their own and never counted as target changes. Operator's answer, recorded in decisions.md on 2026-10-19. Standing.
2026-10-23 T-0055 The operator's baseline becomes `docs/reviews/2026-10-19.md`, the baseline review, copied byte for byte from `02e403f:requests/T-0055.md`. Only its first line changes, to `# Review 2026-10-19: baseline scorecard, 2026-10-03 to 2026-10-19`. That keeps the operator's window in the title and the "Review <date>" form of later reviews. The template's six sections are omitted there, as the answer allows. Operator's answer to round-1 question 2, on what `STATUS.md` holds before the first review.
2026-10-23 T-0055 The baseline review is the one review whose numbers were counted by hand. Every later review pastes `factory stats` output, and writes "not yet computed" for a number it does not compute yet. Standing.
2026-10-23 T-0055 The baseline names four commit SHAs from the Nanobot fork. This run's briefing bars a spec from copying such SHAs. They stay, because the operator asked for the baseline verbatim. No acceptance check reads them.
2026-10-23 T-0055 `STATUS.md` quotes six of the baseline's figures for each instance: changes merged, escapes, operator touches per change, median wall time, median lead time, and runs with a cost record. It gives the date 2026-10-19, says the figures were counted by hand, and says that `factory stats` computes them from #117 on. Which six to show is my call, and the operator may change it at this gate. Each cell must stay a copy of a cell in that instance's table of the review.
2026-10-23 T-0055 `STATUS.md`'s top of the queue copies issue #96 as re-ordered on 2026-10-19, after its row 1, which is this change: #117, #105, #118.
2026-10-23 T-0055 The rule for factory work becomes a fourth working rule in the north star's "How it decides where effort goes", beside "Measure before and after". README's "Filing a request from an issue tracker" and `CONTRIBUTING.md` restate it in short. Standing: every later factory ticket's request says which half of the rule it meets, and the operator applies the rule at the spec gate.
2026-10-23 T-0055 The north star's scorecard table names the five numbers the scorecard request asks `factory stats` to compute. Change failure rate is escapes divided by target changes merged. It is defined under the outside comparisons, not added as a sixth row.
2026-10-23 T-0055 README's first screen names the folder `docs/reviews/`, not one named review, so a review never has to edit README. `STATUS.md`, which every review rewrites anyway, links the latest review by name and the folder.
2026-10-23 T-0055 README stays within its 1,185-line budget, with room left for T-0058. This change adds 8 lines to README, so README ends at 1,182. T-0058, the bug ticket at this same gate, adds about one line and also requires 1,185 or fewer, so both fit in either merge order. To fit, the rule in "Filing a request from an issue tracker" joins that section's first paragraph rather than taking a paragraph of its own, and the north-star paragraph takes three lines. Rejected: raising the budget. T-0058's spec checks the 1,185 figure itself, so a higher budget here would not stop it parking if it merged second, and it would modify three current-truth requirements this change does not otherwise need.
2026-10-23 T-0055 README's north-star paragraph names its three pages as code, `docs/north-star.md`, `STATUS.md` and `docs/reviews/`, not as Markdown links. README has no Markdown links anywhere. The new pages, which are short and read on GitHub, use links.
2026-10-23 T-0055 The first-screen block is a paragraph that opens with the bold label "North star.", not a heading, because README's "Headings are the contract" rule keeps its section names and order fixed.
2026-10-23 T-0055 One changelog entry records the change, because it rewrites the north star's position. The changelog has recorded such a change before: entry 73 (issue #110, commit `21f90c4`) changed `docs/north-star.md` and README and left `docs/design.md` alone. T-0049 declined an entry because its change left `docs/design.md` alone and did not touch the north star either.
2026-10-23 T-0055 The review template reminds the writer that this repository is public: name a change by ticket id, give counts, and name no private product.
2026-10-23 T-0056 T-0056 (#117): interventions outside the CLI are recorded with factory intervention add; a store record that carries a link keeps only a hash of it, never the link (Green for the operator, 2026-10-23, from the public-repo rule)
2026-10-25 T-0056 Interventions made outside the CLI are recorded with `factory intervention add --kind <word> [--ticket T-n] [--note "<line>"]`, which writes one `intervention.recorded` line in the store's event log, and the scorecard counts it. The operator, or a runner session (a Claude Code session that runs the factory for the operator) acting for the operator, runs it after each such action (Answer 2, question 1, option (a); standing, which means later tickets must follow it).
2026-10-25 T-0056 The store keeps no issue link (Answer 2, question 2, option (b); standing for every later record that carries a link). `factory escape add` requires `--issue` and keeps only `issue_sha256`: the SHA-256 of the `--issue` text exactly as given, encoded as UTF-8, written as 64 lowercase hex characters. The operator matches a record to its issue by hashing the link the same way. A hash cannot be turned back into the link, but anyone who already knows or guesses the exact link can confirm a match; README says so. The command prints the hash, never the link. A `--note` on `escape add` or `intervention add` that contains `://` is refused, so the free-text note cannot carry a link either; this is the one check added beyond the answer, and it rejects only text that looks like a URL.
2026-10-25 T-0056 The scorecard is opt-in: `factory stats --scorecard --since WHEN [--until WHEN] [--transcripts DIR]…` prints only the scorecard, so a review pastes the whole output. Without `--scorecard`, the output is byte for byte today's.
2026-10-25 T-0056 The windows are `[--since, --until)` and the window of the same length just before it. `--until` defaults to now. `--scorecard` without `--since` is refused with exit 2.
2026-10-25 T-0056 Each instance declares its kind with an optional `target_is_factory: true|false` in its `instance.yaml` (Answer 1, standing). Missing or false: its merges are target changes. Any other value: `stats --scorecard` refuses with exit 2. `factory stats` finds a store's instance as the nearest directory above the store that holds `.factory/instance.yaml` whose `state_dir` resolves to that store, and names its table after that directory. A store with no such instance is named by its path, its heading says "no instance found", and its merges count as target changes.
2026-10-25 T-0056 A change is a parent ticket (an id with no `.N`) whose last `ticket.transition` to `closed` is in the window and which has at least one `merge.done` for itself or a sub-ticket. Same as the baseline.
2026-10-25 T-0056 An escape counts against the window in which its change closed, when recorded before the report's end. A change with several escape records counts once. The row prints ticket ids, never links or notes (request part B).
2026-10-25 T-0056 CLI decisions are `approval.recorded` and `human.resolved` events in the window. Interventions are, in the window: a `ticket.transition` whose `by` is not `workflow`, `merge`, `parent-check` or `ready-implementers` and that has no `approval.recorded` or `human.resolved` event for the same ticket within 2 seconds; a `spec.added` whose source is not a run id; a `decision.recorded` with `via: decision add`; and an `intervention.recorded` (Answer 2). Decisions and interventions per change is their sum divided by the window's changes. This stands in for hours of operator attention (T-0055's standing decision). Standing: later tickets that add a human command say which of the two it counts as.
2026-10-25 T-0056 The row name stays T-0055's "Tokens and wall time per change", which settles triage's wording gap. Its first line is the median of each change's summed run wall time, in hours. Its sub-rows are the median tokens (context plus output) over the changes whose every run has tokens, the runs by token source, and the dollars on the records that carry them. Dollars are reported but never estimated.
2026-10-25 T-0056 A change's runs are every finished run of the parent or its sub-tickets, killed ones included, because they took time and tokens. The baseline summed `run.finished` events only, so killed runs make this figure slightly higher than a baseline-style count.
2026-10-25 T-0056 A run's tokens come from its cost record, else (with `--transcripts`) from the transcript section D's rule places, as section D does today.
2026-10-25 T-0056 Lead time runs from the parent's `ticket.created` event to its last `merge.done`. The baseline started from the earliest of the request's date, the issue's creation and the ticket's creation. The store holds only the last, so this figure can be shorter than the baseline's for a request filed late.
2026-10-25 T-0056 Root cause C is fixed where the record is written: `run finish --transcripts DIR` (repeatable) records the tokens of the run's transcript when the run has no reply usage. Both Workflow scripts pass it on every `run finish`; `factory drive` passes it on all three of its `run finish` calls. The directory is `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/projects`, else `$HOME/.claude/projects`. It is passed explicitly, never defaulted inside `run finish`, so a test with a throwaway HOME never reads the operator's transcripts.
2026-10-25 T-0056 A transcript record is kept under the run's existing `claude:` key as `{source: transcript, transcript: <path>, usage: {input_tokens, cache_read_input_tokens, cache_creation_input_tokens, output_tokens}, total_cost_usd: null}`. Section D therefore counts it as a record with no change to its code, and its "USD from records" column covers only the records that carry dollars; README says so. A reply record keeps its exact current shape (`tests/factory/test_drive.py:167`).
2026-10-25 T-0056 `run finish` matches a transcript by the rule section D already uses (`factory/cost.py` `match_transcripts`) for that one store and run, with no upper time bound because the run is finishing. It opens only files modified at or after the run's `started`.
2026-10-25 T-0056 `factory escape add <ticket> --issue <link> [--note "<line>"]` writes one `escape.recorded` event, holding the hash above and no link, and nothing else. It is refused with exit 2, writing nothing, for an unknown ticket, a sub-ticket id (the message names the parent), a ticket with no `merge.done` for itself or a sub-ticket, an empty `--issue`, or a `--note` containing `://`. The ticket need not be closed yet.
2026-10-25 T-0056 Both new commands are writes. The live-store fence refuses them unmarked while a run is in flight, as its first requirement already says for every command outside its read-only list, so live-store-guard does not change.
2026-10-25 T-0056 `escape_add` and `intervention_add` live in `factory/human.py` beside `decision_add`, and the harness-code requirement that pins that module's names is modified to list them. Rejected: a new module, which the harness-code checks that read the five split modules would not cover.
2026-10-25 T-0056 README's line budget rises from 1,185 to 1,225 lines in each of the four current-truth harness-docs requirements that state it (MODIFIED in this change), and this change adds at most 30 lines net to README (the draft adds 28, from 1,184). The operator approves the figure at this gate.
2026-10-25 T-0056 No changelog entry: `docs/design.md` does not change (precedent: T-0049).
2026-10-25 T-0056 The change is built as two sub-tickets (design.md, heading "Size and seams"), and this spec ends NEEDS-SPLIT, so the build sends it to the planner, which splits it on those seams. Either the status or the heading alone sends it there.
2026-10-25 T-0059 T-0059 (#120): the gate's current-truth replay skips the scenarios that wrap the whole harness suite, which the same gate already runs (Green for the operator, 2026-10-25)

## Approved changes not yet archived

### T-0057: Check a spec's format when the spec is added, and send a format error back to the spec writer instead of to the human gate (planned)
Change folder: `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/openspec/changes/T-0057`
Changes: build-dispatch: ADDED A spec that spec add refuses as malformed goes back to the spec writer as a new round; build-dispatch: ADDED A spec refused in the last round parks the ticket with the refusal; harness-docs: ADDED The documents record the format check at spec add and its route back to the spec writer; harness-suite: ADDED The suite passes with this change, which changes only the two test files its decisions overturn; role-inputs: ADDED The spec writer's run after a refused draft receives the refusal and that draft; spec-format-check: ADDED spec add refuses a malformed spec where current truth is enabled; spec-format-check: ADDED approve-spec keeps its own check; spec-format-check: ADDED spec add is unchanged where current truth is not enabled, and for a NEEDS-HUMAN draft
Decisions:
- When the store has an `openspec/` tree, `spec add` runs the same check as `approve-spec`: well formed, and its changes apply to current truth. On failure it refuses with exit 2 and the error `spec not added: <the errors, joined by "; ">`, and writes nothing. The errors are exactly the ones `approve-spec` prints after `spec not pinned: `.
- The check covers `--file` sources and every `--from-run` source except a run that finished NEEDS-HUMAN. That draft carries open questions, and it is stored as today so the operator can read it. Rejected: refusing it. Its question would then reach the operator with no stored draft.
- Both runners, the driver and the intake Workflow script, read a `spec add` refusal whose first line starts `spec not added: ` as a form error. Any other refusal keeps the `harness-bug: spec add: …` park.
- A form error uses up a round. The writer's draft counts as round `max(stored round, 1)`, because the stored round is still 0 before the first move to the critic. If that is below `max_rounds.spec`, the runner sets the round one higher with `ticket set <id> round.spec=<n>` and runs the spec writer again. The ticket stays at `ready-for-spec-writer`. Rejected: a `ready-for-spec-writer → ready-for-spec-writer` routing edge, which would mean editing every instance's `instance.yaml`, a protected path, and the Nanobot instance's by hand. An instance left unedited would then park on the route. Rejected: a new round command, a new write that the live-store fence and README would also have to list.
- When no round is left, the ticket parks as `max rounds: <the refusal's first line>`. In that line each backtick, `$` and `\` becomes `'`, in both runners, so the driver and the script record the same reason and the clerk's shell runs nothing. Today's `park()` already turns each `"` into `'`.
- The writer's next input is built from what the store already holds, and nothing new is recorded. It gets one extra section when its previous finished spec-writer run ended READY-FOR-CRITIC or NEEDS-SPLIT, no `spec.added` event names that run as its source, and the check refuses that run's output now. The section is that run's `output.md`, titled "Your previous output, which the harness refused to store as a spec version", and it opens with the refusal. Rejected: `spec add` writing a refusal record, which breaks the rule that a refusal writes nothing. So the section is derived when the input is built; it is not a record of the refusal. Two edges follow. A draft the operator later stores by hand with `spec add --file` still shows as refused, if the run's own output fails the check. A draft refused only because current truth has changed since then does not show.
- This overturns, for a refused spec only, the 2026-10-07 T-0032 standing decision that later refusal kinds, "#68 format" among them, use the empty-output retry: one re-dispatch, then a park. The operator's Answer 1 (2026-10-19, recorded in `decisions.md` on 2026-10-20) chose a new round counted against the round limit. The operator approves the overturn at this gate.
- Standing, from Answer 1: a form error the harness can detect goes back to the role that produced it as a new round, and does not park until the rounds run out.
- README grows by at most one line net, measured against the change's base, so it fits under the current 1,185 cap and under T-0056's 1,225 in either merge order. Rejected: raising the cap here, which would collide with T-0056's edit of the same four requirements.
- `docs/design.md` gets one routing-table row for the new route, and `docs/changelog.md` gets one entry. The entry takes the next free number and opens `<n>. After issue #105 `. No `docs/prompts/` file changes, because no prompt block changes.
