## Context for this run (composed by the harness, not part of the request)

Repository: `spec-factory`, the design repo at `~/dev/spec-factory` (branch `main`). It holds the
design and the harness that runs it:
- `docs/design.md`, the design document and the source of truth, with its changelog in
  `docs/changelog.md`;
- `docs/prompts/`, each file a verbatim copy of one prompt block in the design doc; it changes only
  by re-copying that block;
- `dev/`, the working documents for building the factory itself: `dev/build-harness.spec.md` (the
  spec for building the harness), `dev/build-harness.plan.md` (the Planner's decomposition of it),
  `dev/P0-intake-skeleton.md` (the walking skeleton) and `dev/issues.md` (this repo's issue index);
- the harness, as code in this repo: `factory/` (the package, its role prompts and its workflow
  scripts), `bin/factory` (the entry point), `agents/` (the agent definition templates) and
  `tests/factory/` (its suite). Install with `uv sync --frozen`; test with
  `uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory`;
- `.factory/`, this repo's own instance of the factory: `instance.yaml`, this briefing,
  `harness.lock`, closed records (`answers/`, `green-pilot/`) and the live store, `state/`.
  The store is tracked on `main` and the operator commits it between steps, so `main` moves even
  when no ticket merges.

Two checkouts. Tickets are built and merged in the dev checkout, `~/dev/spec-factory` on `main`.
The factory runs from the runtime checkout, `~/dev/spec-factory-harness`, a detached worktree of
this repo at the harness revision `.factory/harness.lock` has accepted. A merge into `main` never
changes the running code; only the upgrade step moves the runtime, after which the instance
refuses its store until `--accept-harness`. Your shell may start in another directory: use
absolute paths, or `cd ~/dev/spec-factory && <cmd>`.

The Nanobot fork at `~/dev/nanobot-upstream` (branch `feat/lionbot-v3.5`) is instance A: a target
with only `.factory/`, run from the same runtime by its own Driver session. This repo's harness was
imported from its retired `feat/lionbot-v3` branch. Read it only to observe what a fix does there; never write there, and never copy its test names,
line numbers or commit SHAs into a spec. Never read or write `~/.nanobot/` (live credentials).

Acceptance commands must be runnable as written from `~/dev/spec-factory` (grep, sed, diff,
`git diff --check` against the documents, the harness suite). A change to the design doc keeps its
own conventions: its changelog entry in `docs/changelog.md`, `dev/build-harness.spec.md`
consistent with the new text, and any `docs/prompts/` file whose block changed re-copied from it.

The request is an issue draft, written from a real pipeline run: where in the documents,
what happened (the evidence), why it matters, a proposed fix, and the Nanobot-side commit
where a harness fix already exists. The evidence is the requirement; the proposed fix is the
requester's suggestion, not a requirement. Verify the as-built fix in the reference harness
before relying on it; a NEW criterion that already passes on this checkout proves nothing.

Output: write your complete output, in your role's required format and ending with the
STATUS / CONFIDENCE / ESCALATIONS trailer, to the file named under "Output file" below. For
every role but the implementer that is the only file you may create or modify. The implementer
also changes files in its own worktree and commits there, and nowhere else. Then return the same
text as your final message.

This repo's current-state page is the top-level `README.md`. A change to a command, state, stop or
path updates it in the same ticket; read its "Maintaining this page" section before editing it.

Who reads what the roles write here: the operator at the spec gate, and a technical reader new to this project reading the README or a PR description. Gloss every term specific to the factory at first use (docs/writing.md).
## Output file
`/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/state/runs/run-0230-spec_writer/output.md`

## Running code
Run every test, script or prototype through this wrapper, which gives it a fresh temporary HOME so it cannot write the operator's real home directory: `(export HOME="$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P)"; <command>)`. Put your command in place of <command>. This includes every test or check command the briefing above gives. A throwaway HOME does not stop a write to an absolute path: never run anything that could write a protected path outside the repository.

## Scratch directory
Put every file you make for your own use in this run under `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/state/runs/run-0230-spec_writer/scratch`: no other run uses it. The harness clears it when the ticket moves on, and keeps it while the ticket is parked.

## Ticket (Triage output)

Type: feature (a design change to where each instance keeps its store; it removes wasted runs rather than fixing wrong output)

Title: Isolate the store from the integration branch: store commits move main and force catch-up runs

Summary:
Every commit to the store forces a catch-up run on any sub-ticket that is mid-check, and none of those commits can change what the checks tested. The store (`.factory/state/`, the factory's ticket, approval and run records for one repository) is tracked on the integration branch, the branch sub-tickets merge into. The merge gate (the step that merges a sub-ticket once its checks pass) refuses a head that does not contain that branch. So a store-only commit makes the implementer merge the branch in and both checkers re-run, at about 10 to 20 minutes and about 1M tokens each time. The requester wants the store moved onto its own branch, still versioned and pushed, so the integration branch moves only on merges. The spec should compare B1 (a store branch checked out as a worktree at the store path) with B2 (a store branch written through git plumbing, with no working copy) on: migrating both instances' existing store history and paths, what `init` sets up, how worktrees and checker checkouts see the store, how operators and runners push, what breaks, and rollback.

Evidence:
- Request: retro trial escalation C1 counted 4 catch-up runs caused this way: run-0082, run-0085, run-0099, run-0122. All four run directories exist under `.factory/state/runs/` (`run-0082-implementer`, `run-0085-implementer`, `run-0099-implementer`, `run-0122-implementer`). I did not find the retro trial's C1 write-up itself in this repo. Other documents only refer to it: `.factory/state/requests/T-0023.md:18` and `.factory/state/plans/T-0018.md`.
- Request: on 2026-10-04 T-0023.3's merge was refused with "head does not contain main" after store commit `5ea66e9`. Verified: `git log` shows `5ea66e9 store(T-0023): .1 and .2 merged; ...` followed by `a1b2718 Merge main into factory/T-0023.3 (conflict run: store commits only)`. `git show --name-only --format= a1b2718 | grep -v '^\.factory/state/'` prints nothing. That means the catch-up merge brought in only store files, so it could not have changed what the checkers tested.
- The refusal is in the gate code. `factory/cli.py:546-550` sets `merge_refused = "head does not contain main"` and raises `Refused(... merge it into {branch} and re-check)`. `factory/cli.py:594` parks the ticket after `MAX_CONFLICT_RUNS` such runs.
- The operator decision record the request cites exists: `.factory/answers/T-0023.3-operator-decision.md`.
- Instance A (the Nanobot fork, `~/dev/nanobot-upstream`, branch `feat/lionbot-v3.5`) also tracks its store on its integration branch: `git ls-files .factory/state` there lists approvals and other records. So the change applies to both instances, as the request says.
- T-0023 deferred this explicitly. `.factory/state/requests/T-0023.md:18` says: "Moving the store off `main` is a design change."
- Operator, relayed with this run: "it's basically option A or B. Worktree and/or branch ; your A is simulating B". This matches the request's framing. Option A, a gate exception for store-only commits, is set aside because it only imitates a separate branch. The choice between B1 and B2 is left open.

Assumptions (mine, not stated by the requester):
- Option A is out of scope as a solution. The spec may describe it only as the rejected comparison. This follows from the operator's relayed note and the request's "(for comparison, not preferred)".
- "Worktree and/or branch" means the operator has not yet chosen between B1 and B2. It may also allow a hybrid. The spec weighs them and recommends one, and the operator decides at the spec gate. No separate triage question is needed, because the request already sends that choice to the spec gate.
- The spec changes the design doc and the harness, given the labels "harness, design-doc". Under this repo's conventions that means a `docs/changelog.md` entry, a consistent `dev/build-harness.spec.md`, and a README update for any changed path or command.
- Migrating instance A's store happens on instance A, driven by its own Driver session. It follows the T-0012 pattern (a paired ticket there) and is not done from this repo, which treats `~/dev/nanobot-upstream/**` as read-only.
- Suggested priority (a suggestion; priority is the operator's call): high. Each occurrence costs about 1M tokens. The 2026-10-04 occurrence also led to the hand-edited-results incident.

Reason:
No duplicate. Searched the GitHub issues (`gh issue list --state all`), `dev/issues.md`, and the store's tickets, requests, specs and plans for "catch-up", "integration branch", "store branch" and "orphan". The only matches were T-0023's explicit deferral of this exact change and this ticket's own request. The nearest issue is #45 / T-0024 ("Roles can write the live instance store"). That is a different problem: a role writing the store, not store commits moving the branch.

The intent is clear and the product decision is already made: real isolation on a separate branch, not a gate exception. The remaining B1-or-B2 choice is a design trade-off the request sends to the spec, and the gate is not pre-approved. The operator decides it there.

Out-of-scope observations:
- Issue number. The operator's note calls this "45". On GitHub this request is #46 ("Isolate the store from the integration branch...", opened 2026-10-04T17:50:05Z), and this ticket's source file is named `46_store_branch.md`. #45 is the roles-writing-the-store issue (T-0024). `dev/issues.md` indexes up to #45 and has no #46 row yet.
- Overlap with T-0024 (#45), whose spec writer is in flight (run-0220). B1 would make the live store a separate worktree, which changes where the store lives and how a role's shell could reach it. The two specs should not contradict each other. The spec writer for this ticket should read T-0024's spec, and the planner may need a cross-ticket dependency.

STATUS: ACCEPT
CONFIDENCE: high. The cited commits, gate code, run directories and decision record exist, and the operator's relayed note settles the only product question; the one gap is that the retro C1 write-up was not found in this repo.
ESCALATIONS: none

## Request (raw)

title: "Isolate the store from the integration branch: store commits move main and force catch-up runs"
labels: "harness, design-doc"
---
**Problem:** the instance's store (`.factory/state/`) is tracked on the integration branch, the same branch sub-tickets merge into (`main` on spec-factory, `feat/lionbot-v3.5` on Nanobot). Every store commit therefore moves the integration branch. Store commits happen between steps: approvals, closes, records. The merge gate requires a checked head to contain the integration branch, so any store commit made while a sub-ticket is in its checks forces a catch-up run: the implementer merges the branch in, and both checkers re-run, about 10 to 20 minutes and about 1M tokens. The store commits touch only `.factory/state/` and cannot change what the checks tested, so the cost is pure overhead.

Tracking the store in git is deliberate: versioned, reviewable, pushed, auditable. Putting it on the code's integration branch was a default, not a decision.

**Evidence:**
- The retro trial's escalation C1 found 4 catch-up runs caused this way (run-0082, run-0085, run-0099, run-0122).
- On 2026-10-04, two more: T-0014.1 (after an index commit) and T-0023.3, whose merge was refused with "head does not contain main" after the store commit `5ea66e9`, and which then needed a catch-up run (`a1b2718`, "store commits only"). That refusal is what led to the hand-edited-results incident (operator decision record `.factory/answers/T-0023.3-operator-decision.md`).

**Options** (the operator's framing, 2026-10-04: a gate exception would only simulate a separate branch, so the choice is about real isolation):
- **B1: a store branch, checked out as a worktree at the store path.** For example, an orphan branch `factory-store`, with `.factory/state/` as a git worktree of it, committed and pushed separately. The integration branch then moves only on merges. Records stay versioned and pushed.
- **B2: a store branch without a worktree.** The harness commits store changes to the branch through git plumbing, with no working copy.
- **A (for comparison, not preferred):** the merge gate ignores integration-branch commits that touch only the store path.

The spec should weigh, for B1 and B2:
- migrating the existing store history and its paths for both instances;
- what `init` sets up;
- how worktrees and checker checkouts see the store, given that they do not need it in their tree;
- how operators and runners push;
- what breaks (anything that reads `.factory/state` from a code checkout, `git log` audit trails);
- rollback.

**Gate:** not pre-approved. It changes repository layout on every instance; the operator reviews at the spec gate.

# build-dispatch

## Requirements

### Requirement: A park reason carries the failing command's error
When a store command fails and its relayed stderr is empty, the workflow scripts MUST put the refusal's JSON `error`, or else the exit code, after the reason's prefix, so that no park reason ends blank.

#### Scenario: A refused archive or sub-ticket add parks with the refusal text
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify"}}, "ticket parent-check": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify", "reuse": "run-0001-verifier"}}, "archive": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "no spec store (factory init not run)"}, "exit": 2}}'; node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-planner"}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "PLANNED"}}, "subticket add": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "ST-2: no Depends on line"}, "exit": 2}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `park: archive: no spec store (factory init not run)`, then `start: planner`, then `park: harness-bug: subticket add: ST-2: no Depends on line`

#### Scenario: A refused run start during intake parks with the refusal text
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/intake.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-triage", "round": {"spec": 0}}}, "run start": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "T-0001 is parked, not ready-for-triage"}, "exit": 2}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: triage`, then `park: harness-bug: run start triage: T-0001 is parked, not ready-for-triage`

#### Scenario: A command that prints no JSON parks with its exit code
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify"}}, "ticket parent-check": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify", "reuse": "run-0001-verifier"}}, "archive": {"raw": "", "exit": 1}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `park: archive: exit 1, no JSON on stdout`

### Requirement: The build runs only the checkers a commit still needs
When a sub-ticket reaches the checks without an implementer run in that pass, the build MUST run only the checkers that have no result row on its commit; after an implementer run it SHALL run both.

#### Scenario: A redispatched sub-ticket runs only the checker whose row was set aside
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show T-0001 ": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "planned"}}, "ticket ready-implementers": [{"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": ["T-0001.1"], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}, {"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}], "ticket show T-0001.1": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "checks-in-flight"}}, "ticket head": {"out": {"ok": true, "head": "abababababababababababababababababababab"}}, "results show": {"out": {"ok": true, "rows": {"verifier": "VERIFIED", "ci": "PASS"}, "missing": ["reviewer"]}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "APPROVE"}}, "ticket join": {"out": {"ok": true, "decision": "park", "reason": "stub stop"}}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: reviewer`, then `park: stub stop`

#### Scenario: After an implementer run both checkers run
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show T-0001 ": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "planned"}}, "ticket ready-implementers": [{"out": {"ok": true, "ready": ["T-0001.1"], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}, {"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}], "ticket show T-0001.1": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-implementer"}}, "ticket head": {"out": {"ok": true, "head": "abababababababababababababababababababab"}}, "results show": {"out": {"ok": true, "rows": {"reviewer": "REQUEST-CHANGES", "verifier": "VERIFIED", "ci": "PASS"}, "missing": []}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "READY-FOR-REVIEW"}}, "ticket join": {"out": {"ok": true, "decision": "park", "reason": "stub stop"}}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: implementer`, `start: reviewer`, `start: verifier`, `park: stub stop`, one per line

## Current truth: harness-docs

# harness-docs

## Requirements

### Requirement: The documents record the change
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain entry 51 covering every part, numbered without a gap, `README.md` SHALL describe the new `resolve` behaviour and relative environment paths, and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the change in order
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print n, (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; sed -n '/^51\. /p' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e BLOCKED -e '--replan' -e 'next free' -e 'error text' -e redispatch -e '-whitespace' -e context.md -e relative -e uncommitted | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `51 CONTIGUOUS`, then `9`

#### Scenario: The README describes the new resolve verbs
- WHEN `(echo "replan=$(grep -c -- '--replan' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') gap=$(grep -c 'has no .resolve. verb' README.md)")`
- THEN it prints `replan=1 gap=0`

#### Scenario: The README says relative paths resolve from the caller's directory
- WHEN `(grep -c 'relative .FACTORY_' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')`
- THEN it prints `1`

#### Scenario: The change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

## Current truth: harness-suite

# harness-suite

## Requirements

### Requirement: The harness suite runs mid-edit without loosening the lock
The harness's own test suite SHALL pass in a checkout that has an uncommitted edit under a harness path, and a store command on an instance's own store run from such a checkout MUST still be refused.

#### Scenario: The harness suite passes with an uncommitted harness edit
The command gives pytest its own temporary directory under `/tmp`, because four existing tests need one outside every repository and instance. Run it as written, whatever `TMPDIR` the caller has set; it removes that directory when it ends.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && P=$(mktemp -d /tmp/t0023-suite.XXXXXX) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && echo '# uncommitted edit' >> $T/c/factory/status.py && cd $T/c && TMPDIR=$P .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | tail -1; rm -rf "$P")`
- THEN it prints one line reporting a number of passed tests and no `failed` or `error`

#### Scenario: The uncommitted-edit refusal still holds on an instance's own store
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && echo '# uncommitted edit' >> $T/c/factory/status.py && git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $T/c/bin/factory init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && $T/c/bin/factory config >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$?"; head -1 $T/err | grep -o 'has uncommitted changes:$')`
- THEN it prints `exit=2`, then `has uncommitted changes:`

## Current truth: human-resolution

## Requirements

### Requirement: A ruling returns a BLOCKED sub-ticket to its implementer
`factory resolve <id> --ruling F` on a park whose reason starts with `BLOCKED` MUST write F as the ticket's next ruling, return it to `ready-for-implementer` at the same round, and the next implementer input SHALL contain the ruling.

#### Scenario: A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling

### Requirement: Existing ruling routes are unchanged
A ruling on a critic ESCALATE park SHALL still return the ticket to `ready-for-critic`.

#### Scenario: A ruling on a critic ESCALATE still returns the ticket to the critic
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); export FACTORY_STATE=$T/store; printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md; bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to ready-for-spec-writer --by t >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to ready-for-critic --by t >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket park T-0001 --reason "ESCALATE from critic" >/dev/null; echo r > $T/r.md; bin/factory resolve T-0001 --ruling $T/r.md >/dev/null; echo "exit=$? $(bin/factory ticket show T-0001 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints `exit=0 ready-for-critic`

### Requirement: A re-plan returns a fully merged parent to its planner
`factory resolve <parent> --replan F` on a parked parent whose sub-tickets have all merged MUST move it to `ready-for-planner` with F as its next ruling, and the next planner input SHALL contain F and list each existing sub-ticket with its title and state; with any sub-ticket not merged it MUST refuse, naming that sub-ticket, and write nothing.

#### Scenario: A re-plan sends a parent whose sub-tickets all merged back to its planner with the note and the sub-ticket list
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-closed.sh && printf 'Re-plan: add one fix for the case-insensitive path.\n' > $T23/note.md; bin/factory resolve T-0001 --replan $T23/note.md >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$? $(bin/factory ticket show T-0001 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')"; R=$(bin/factory run start --role planner --ticket T-0001 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'); [ -n "$R" ] && bin/factory run compose $R >/dev/null; I=$FACTORY_STATE/runs/${R:-none}/input.md; echo "in_input=$(cat $I 2>/dev/null | grep -c 'Re-plan: add one fix') listed=$(cat $I 2>/dev/null | grep -cxF -e '- T-0001.1 / First: merged' -e '- T-0001.2 / Second: merged')")`

- THEN it prints `names=1`, then `parked spec-v1.yaml ` (still parked, and no ruling file written)

### Requirement: A redispatch sets aside only rows that did not pass
`factory resolve <id> --redispatch` MUST keep a reviewer row that is `APPROVE`, and the verifier and gate rows together when they are `VERIFIED` and `PASS`, and SHALL move every other row of that commit to `superseded-<n>/`.

#### Scenario: A redispatch after a killed reviewer keeps the verifier's passing rows
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && printf 'ST-1 / Do it\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan.md >/dev/null && H=abababababababababababababababababababab && bin/factory ticket set T-0001.1 status=checks-in-flight head=$H >/dev/null && printf "Commit: $H\nGate suite: PASS\nSTATUS: VERIFIED\nCONFIDENCE: high, fixture\nESCALATIONS: none\n" > $T23/v.md && bin/factory results record T-0001.1 --head $H --role verifier --output $T23/v.md --run run-0002-verifier >/dev/null && bin/factory results record T-0001.1 --head $H --role reviewer --killed --run run-0003-reviewer >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket park T-0001.1 --reason "budget kill: reviewer" >/dev/null && bin/factory resolve T-0001.1 --redispatch >/dev/null && echo "kept: $(ls $FACTORY_STATE/results/$H | grep yaml | tr '\n' ' ')" && echo "set aside: $(ls $FACTORY_STATE/results/$H/superseded-1 | tr '\n' ' ')")`
- THEN it prints `kept: ci.yaml verifier.yaml `, then `set aside: reviewer.yaml `

#### Scenario: A redispatch after a verifier SPEC-DEFECT keeps the reviewer's approval
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && printf 'ST-1 / Do it\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan.md >/dev/null && H=abababababababababababababababababababab && bin/factory ticket set T-0001.1 status=checks-in-flight head=$H >/dev/null && printf "Commit: $H\nGate suite: FAIL\nSTATUS: SPEC-DEFECT\nCONFIDENCE: high, fixture\nESCALATIONS: none\n" > $T23/v.md && printf "Commit: $H\nSTATUS: APPROVE\nCONFIDENCE: high, fixture\nESCALATIONS: none\n" > $T23/r.md && bin/factory results record T-0001.1 --head $H --role verifier --output $T23/v.md --run run-0002-verifier >/dev/null && bin/factory results record T-0001.1 --head $H --role reviewer --output $T23/r.md --run run-0003-reviewer >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket park T-0001.1 --reason "SPEC-DEFECT from verifier" >/dev/null && bin/factory resolve T-0001.1 --redispatch >/dev/null && echo "kept: $(ls $FACTORY_STATE/results/$H | grep yaml | tr '\n' ' ')" && echo "set aside: $(ls $FACTORY_STATE/results/$H/superseded-1 | tr '\n' ' ')")`

## Current truth: store-setup

# store-setup

## Requirements

### Requirement: Run records are exempt from whitespace checks
A store that `init` or `run start` has touched MUST hold a `.gitattributes` with the line `runs/** -whitespace`, so that `git diff --check` SHALL NOT report run records while it still reports every other store file.

#### Scenario: Run records in a store pass whitespace checks and other store files do not
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && git init -q -b main $T/r && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && FACTORY_STATE=$T/r/store bin/factory init >/dev/null && git -C $T/r add -A && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q -m store && mkdir -p $T/r/store/runs/run-0001-verifier && printf 'context \n x\n' > $T/r/store/runs/run-0001-verifier/diff.patch && git -C $T/r add -A && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q -m record && git -C $T/r diff --check HEAD~1 HEAD >/dev/null; echo "runs=$?"; printf 'x \n' > $T/r/store/notes.md && git -C $T/r add -A && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q -m notes && git -C $T/r diff --check HEAD~1 HEAD >/dev/null; echo "other=$?")`
- THEN it prints `runs=0`, then `other=2`

#### Scenario: A run start adds the whitespace rule to an existing store
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && bin/factory run start --role planner --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null && echo "rule=$(cat $FACTORY_STATE/.gitattributes 2>/dev/null | grep -cxF 'runs/** -whitespace')")`
- THEN it prints `rule=1`

### Requirement: No half instance, and a missing briefing refuses
`factory init` MUST refuse with exit 2, writing nothing, when it would create an instance while `FACTORY_STATE` names another store; `run compose` MUST refuse with exit 2, writing no input, when the instance has no `context.md`.

#### Scenario: init refuses to create an instance on a throwaway store and writes nothing
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && FACTORY_STATE=$T/s $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? instance=$([ -e $T/tgt/.factory ] && echo written || echo none) store=$([ -e $T/s ] && echo written || echo none) names_state=$(grep -c FACTORY_STATE $T/err)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 instance=none store=none names_state=1`

#### Scenario: A missing briefing refuses the compose with exit 2
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && rm .factory/context.md && export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md && $B ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null && $B run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null && $B run compose run-0001-triage >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? input=$([ -e $T/s/runs/run-0001-triage/input.md ] && echo written || echo none) names_context=$(grep -c 'context.md' $T/err)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 input=none names_context=1`

### Requirement: Relative environment paths resolve from the caller's directory
A relative `FACTORY_STATE`, `FACTORY_INSTANCE` or `FACTORY_REPO` MUST resolve against the directory the command was run from; an absolute value SHALL be used as given.

#### Scenario: Relative FACTORY_STATE, FACTORY_INSTANCE and FACTORY_REPO resolve against the caller's directory
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; F=$(cd tests/factory/fixtures/instance && pwd -P); s=$(cd $T && FACTORY_INSTANCE=$F FACTORY_STATE=rel/store $B paths | tail -1); i=$(cd $F/.. && FACTORY_INSTANCE=instance $B paths | tail -1); r=$(cd $T && FACTORY_INSTANCE=$F FACTORY_REPO=rel $B paths | tail -1); echo "state=$(echo "$s" | grep -cF "\"state\": \"$T/rel/store\"") instance=$(echo "$i" | grep -cF "\"instance\": \"$F\"") repo=$(echo "$r" | grep -cF "\"state\": \"$T/rel/.factory/state\"")")`
- THEN it prints `state=1 instance=1 repo=1`

#### Scenario: An absolute FACTORY_STATE is used as given
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; F=$(cd tests/factory/fixtures/instance && pwd -P); cd / && echo "absolute=$(FACTORY_INSTANCE=$F FACTORY_STATE=$T/abs $B paths | tail -1 | grep -cF "\"state\": \"$T/abs\"")")`
- THEN it prints `absolute=1`

## Current truth: sub-ticket-planning

# sub-ticket-planning

## Requirements

### Requirement: A later plan's sub-tickets continue the parent's numbering
`factory subticket add` on a parent that already has sub-tickets MUST number the new ones from the next free index, SHALL accept a `Depends on:` line naming an existing sub-ticket, and MUST refuse a plan whose head line reuses an existing sub-ticket's id, writing nothing.

#### Scenario: A later plan's sub-tickets take the next free ids and may depend on a merged sibling
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-closed.sh && printf 'ST-1 / Fix the bypass\nDepends on: T-0001.2\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan2.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan2.md 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | grep -o '"id": "[^"]*"\|"depends_on": \[[^]]*\]'; bin/factory ticket ready-implementers T-0001 | tail -1 | grep -o '"ready": \[[^]]*\]')`
- THEN it prints `"id": "T-0001.3"`, then `"depends_on": ["T-0001.2"]`, then `"ready": ["T-0001.3"]`

#### Scenario: A plan that reuses an existing sub-ticket id is refused and writes nothing
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-closed.sh && printf 'T-0001.1 / Again\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan3.md; bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan3.md >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$? $(ls $FACTORY_STATE/tickets | tr '\n' ' ')")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 T-0001.1.yaml T-0001.2.yaml T-0001.yaml `

## Decision log (decisions.md): standing decisions, read-only

2026-10-04 T-0023 `resolve --ruling F` also accepts a park whose reason starts with `BLOCKED`. It writes F as the next `approvals/<id>/ruling-<n>.md` and returns the sub-ticket to `ready-for-implementer` at the same round.
2026-10-04 T-0023 `resolve PARENT --replan F` moves a parked parent whose sub-tickets have all merged to `ready-for-planner`, with F as its next ruling. The planner receives F and plans the fix. Rejected: the requester's `--replan --file <plan>` straight to `planned`. It needs a new routing edge, which the queue policy does not count as small. It would also skip the planner. `dev/build-harness.spec.md` already sends a re-plan through the planner.
2026-10-04 T-0023 On a re-plan, the planner's input lists the parent's existing sub-tickets, each with its title and state. The human's note F therefore needs to say only what to fix. Rejected: asking the human to restate in F what has merged, which the store already knows.
2026-10-04 T-0023 Sub-tickets that a later plan adds take the next free ids under the parent, and their `Depends on:` lines may name the parent's existing sub-tickets. A plan head line that reuses an existing sub-ticket's id is refused. Rejected: honouring explicit non-colliding ids, a second numbering rule that the planner's free-form ids would make ambiguous.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A park reason is never blank. When the clerk relays an empty stderr, the workflows use the refusal's JSON `error`, and failing that `exit <n>, no JSON on stdout` or `exit <n>, no error text`. Rejected: editing each of the 26 reason sites.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A redispatch sets aside a checker's rows only when they did not pass. The reviewer's row is kept when it is `APPROVE`. The verifier and gate rows are kept together when they are `VERIFIED` and `PASS`, because one verifier run writes both. The build then runs only the checkers with no row on that commit. After an implementer run it still runs both. Rejected: a `--roles` flag on redispatch, which no reported case needs.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The store gets a `.gitattributes` holding `runs/** -whitespace`. `init` and every `run start` write it the way they already write `.gitignore`. Rejected: rewriting committed records, and excluding the store path inside each gate command.
2026-10-04 T-0023 `init` refuses, with exit 2 and nothing written, to create an instance while `FACTORY_STATE` names another store. A compose with no `context.md` refuses with exit 2. Rejected: writing every instance piece from a throwaway-store `init`. That contradicts the rule that such a run initialises only that store.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A relative `FACTORY_INSTANCE`, `FACTORY_STATE` or `FACTORY_REPO` resolves against the caller's directory: `FACTORY_CWD`, else the working directory.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The suite's own-store cases that are not about the uncommitted-edit refusal run the CLI through a test-only launcher that stubs that one check. The refusal itself keeps its tests on a clone's real `bin/factory`. Rejected: a switch the production CLI honours, which would loosen the check. Also rejected: running every case from a committed snapshot of the working tree, which changes every assertion that names this checkout's revision or paths.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The suite scenario gives pytest a fresh temporary directory under `/tmp` and removes it afterwards. Four existing tests need a temporary directory outside every repository, and an agent's scratch directory lies inside this one. The scenario states this in its command, so no role has to choose between its scratch rule and a valid run. Rejected: fixing those four tests in this ticket, which is beyond H8 and needs its own design (Out-of-scope observations).
2026-10-04 T-0023 The workflow-script fixes are checked by acceptance scenarios that run the scripts under node with a stub clerk. They get no suite test, because the suite does not need node today and adding that would change what the gate needs.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The change is built as four seams (design.md, "Size and seams"). They share one changelog entry, 51.
2026-10-04 T-0024 T-0024: instance B keeps the spec store created 2026-10-04 by run-0196; its tickets close by archive into current truth (operator)
2026-10-04 T-0024 While a role run is in flight on a live store, a human or runner writes it by prefixing that one command with FACTORY_DISPATCH=1; README documents it and the refusal text never names it (operator)

## Human gate: changes requested

Changes requested at the spec gate (operator delegated to the Green session; Fable design review round 1: `.factory/answers/design-review-45-46/round-1.md`):

1. BLOCKING (review finding 1): `init_cmd` resolves the repo with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (cli.py:821-825, :853). From a cwd inside the store worktree, that returns the store worktree root, so `init` would create a phantom instance inside the live store (`<store>/.factory/instance.yaml`, `context.md`, `harness.lock`, `.claude/agents/*`, a nested store), unfenced by #45, and later role commands would walk up to it. v2's claim that the change "does not alter how a role's shell finds the store" is false for `init`. Fix: resolve the main worktree (for example, the parent of `--git-common-dir`), or refuse when the toplevel is the factory-store worktree or the caller's cwd lies under an existing instance. Add a scenario: `init --repo-name x` run from `<store>/runs/<id>/scratch` refuses with exit 2 and leaves the store unchanged.
2. SHOULD-FIX (finding 3): A.3's "exactly one remote-tracking `<remote>/factory-store`, else create an orphan" would silently create an empty orphan when two remotes carry it. Nanobot has `fork` and `nas`. When more than one remote has it and no local branch exists, refuse and name the remotes.
3. SHOULD-FIX (finding 4): a stale fact. Nanobot's live worktree is `.factory/state/worktrees/T-0004.1`, not T-0001.1, and it has uncommitted store files. Re-derive the facts at writing time, or phrase them so they don't go stale.
4. NOTE (finding 5): migration step 4's `status --porcelain` cannot see ignored files. Verify the step-3 copy (for example by comparing `ls-files -o -i` lists or file counts) before step 5 deletes the old directory.
5. NOTE (finding 6): README must say that `git clean -ffdx` (double f) deletes the store worktree, while `-fdx` keeps it.
6. NOTE (finding 7): in part A, do the worktree step before the agent-file copy, so that an "already used by worktree" failure writes nothing.
7. NOTE (finding 8): README line: checking out a pre-move commit recreates `.factory/state` and the old `state_dir`, and commands during that checkout hit the stale copy.
8. NOTE (finding 11): Nanobot's `protected_paths` doesn't cover the store. Name `.factory/store/**` for the paired Nanobot migration step.
9. Rebase on #45 (T-0024), which builds first and also edits `init_cmd` and `main()`. Keep #45's fence, and the order "fence before any write"; `store migrate` is fenced by #45's default. Say so.
