## Context for this run (composed by the harness, not part of the request)

Repository: `spec-factory`, the design repo at `~/dev/spec-factory` (branch `main`). It holds the
design and the harness that runs it:
- `docs/design.md`, the design document and the source of truth, with its changelog in
  `docs/changelog.md`;
- `docs/prompts/`, each file a verbatim copy of one prompt block in the design doc; it changes only
  by re-copying that block;
- `dev/`, the working documents for building the factory itself: `dev/build-harness.spec.md` (the
  spec for building the harness), `dev/build-harness.plan.md` (the Planner's decomposition of it),
  `dev/P0-intake-skeleton.md` (the walking skeleton) and `dev/issues.md` (this repo's issue index);
- the harness, as code in this repo: `factory/` (the package, its role prompts and its workflow
  scripts), `bin/factory` (the entry point), `agents/` (the agent definition templates) and
  `tests/factory/` (its suite). Install with `uv sync --frozen`; test with
  `uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory`;
- `.factory/`, this repo's own instance of the factory: `instance.yaml`, this briefing,
  `harness.lock`, closed records (`answers/`, `green-pilot/`) and the live store, `store/`.
  The store is a checkout of its own branch, `factory-store`; the operator commits it there, so a
  store commit never moves `main`.

Two checkouts. Tickets are built and merged in the dev checkout, `~/dev/spec-factory` on `main`.
The factory runs from the runtime checkout, `~/dev/spec-factory-harness`, a detached worktree of
this repo at the harness revision `.factory/harness.lock` has accepted. A merge into `main` never
changes the running code; only the upgrade step moves the runtime, after which the instance
refuses its store until `--accept-harness`. Your shell may start in another directory: use
absolute paths, or `cd ~/dev/spec-factory && <cmd>`.

The Nanobot fork at `~/dev/nanobot-upstream` (branch `feat/lionbot-v3.5`) is instance A: a target
with only `.factory/`, run from the same runtime by its own Driver session. This repo's harness was
imported from its retired `feat/lionbot-v3` branch. Read it only to observe what a fix does there; never write there, and never copy its test names,
line numbers or commit SHAs into a spec. Never read or write `~/.nanobot/` (live credentials).

Acceptance commands must be runnable as written from `~/dev/spec-factory` (grep, sed, diff,
`git diff --check` against the documents, the harness suite). A change to the design doc keeps its
own conventions: its changelog entry in `docs/changelog.md`, `dev/build-harness.spec.md`
consistent with the new text, and any `docs/prompts/` file whose block changed re-copied from it.

The request is an issue draft, written from a real pipeline run: where in the documents,
what happened (the evidence), why it matters, a proposed fix, and the Nanobot-side commit
where a harness fix already exists. The evidence is the requirement; the proposed fix is the
requester's suggestion, not a requirement. Verify the as-built fix in the reference harness
before relying on it; a NEW criterion that already passes on this checkout proves nothing.

Output: write your complete output, in your role's required format and ending with the
STATUS / CONFIDENCE / ESCALATIONS trailer, to the file named under "Output file" below. For
every role but the implementer that is the only file you may create or modify. The implementer
also changes files in its own worktree and commits there, and nowhere else. Then return the same
text as your final message.

This repo's current-state page is the top-level `README.md`. A change to a command, state, stop or
path updates it in the same ticket; read its "Maintaining this page" section before editing it.

Who reads what the roles write here: the operator at the spec gate, and a technical reader new to this project reading the README or a PR description. Gloss every term specific to the factory at first use (docs/writing.md).
## Output file
`/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/runs/run-0370-critic/output.md`

## Running code
Run every test, script or prototype through this wrapper, which gives it a fresh temporary HOME so it cannot write the operator's real home directory: `(export HOME="$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P)"; <command>)`. Put your command in place of <command>. This includes every test or check command the briefing above gives. A throwaway HOME does not stop a write to an absolute path: never run anything that could write a protected path outside the repository.

## Scratch directory
Put every file you make for your own use in this run under `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/runs/run-0370-critic/scratch`: no other run uses it. The harness clears it when the ticket moves on, and keeps it while the ticket is parked.

## Spec under review (v2)

=== proposal.md
## Problem

Five of the factory's seven role prompts lack the reading rules that cut the spec writer's token use by about 37% at the same quality. The five are triage, planner, implementer, code reviewer and verifier. The operator pays for those tokens on every ticket. The implementer and the verifier pay the most, because they run test suites and other long commands. The factory runs each step of a ticket as a separate model agent, a "role": triage sorts a request, the spec writer drafts a spec, the critic checks it, the planner splits it into sub-tickets, the implementer writes the code, the code reviewer reads the diff and the verifier re-runs the checks. Each role is steered by its own written prompt.

An agent works in turns. A turn is one call to the model, and every call re-sends everything the agent has read so far in the run. A file read whole, or a test run printed in full, is paid for again on every later turn. Issue #73 gave the spec writer and the critic a short paragraph of reading rules: put independent reads and commands in one turn, read only the line range a search found, and send long command output to a file in the run's scratch directory (a per-run folder for temporary files), then search or tail that file. In the operator's replay of past runs, the spec writer's tokens fell by about 37% with the same spec quality. The same replay found no saving for the critic, whose prompt #73 had also given a cap on how much it could check. That cap made it check less, and it was removed. The reading rules stayed.

This change adds the same paragraph to the five other prompts and to nothing else.

Each prompt exists in three copies that must agree: a block in the design document, a verbatim copy of that block under `docs/prompts/`, and the copy the harness actually sends (`factory/prompts/`), which differs from the documented one only where the harness fills in values. All three copies change. The operator's replay of past build runs then decides whether the running harness moves to the new prompts.

## Evidence

- The paragraph exists today only in the spec writer and critic prompts. Critic form, `factory/prompts/critic.md` lines 50-55 (and `docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md` lines 50-55, `docs/design.md` lines 485-490):
  "Turn economy: every turn re-sends everything read so far, so a wasted turn or a long printout costs again on every later turn. Put independent reads and commands in one turn. Once grep has found the lines you need, read that line range, not the whole file. Send long output to a file in your scratch directory and grep or tail it, rather than printing it in full."
  The spec writer's form (`factory/prompts/spec_writer.md` lines 59-65, `docs/design.md` lines 378-384) adds "such as a suite run or a scenario's output" and "Write the spec in as few writes as you can, ideally one."
- `grep -i 'turn economy'` over `factory/prompts/`, `docs/prompts/` and `docs/design.md` matches only those two prompts. The five target prompts have none. Run against this checkout, scenario "The five role prompts carry the critic's reading paragraph in every copy" prints `doc=0 run=0` for all five roles.
- The 37% result is changelog entry 59 (`docs/changelog.md` line 63, the #74 entry: "found that #73's spec writer rules cut its tokens by about 37% at the same quality"). The same entry records the other half: #73's critic rules "saved nothing (0.71M to 0.72M, 1.0M to 0.93M, 1.67M to 1.63M tokens) and made the critic check less". It missed one Nanobot risk and one declaration bug that the earlier prompt had caught. #73 had given the critic more than the reading paragraph: a cap of two paths and one command per claim, and a ban on clones, worktrees and prototypes. Entry 59 (#74, T-0035) removed the cap and the ban and kept "the three reading rules". So the one measured case where #73's rules did not pay came bundled with the cap, and the reading rules have a measured saving only on the spec writer. The request cites entry 58, which records the #73 change itself and the 309M of 866M spec-writer token share. I could not find a source in this repo for the request's 18% (implementer) and 13% (verifier) token shares. They motivate the change but no criterion depends on them.
- The three copies agree today: for triage, planner, implementer, code reviewer and verifier, each design block is byte-identical to its `docs/prompts/` file. The run copies differ from the documented ones only by harness fills: `{gate commands}` and `{force-push allowed}` in the implementer, `{gate commands}` in the verifier, `{2}` in the reviewer, and an instance-added "Acceptance items describe behaviour" block at the end of triage's RULES.
- Every role run, the five included, receives a "Scratch directory" section in its input (`factory/compose.py` lines 186-188), so "your scratch directory" means something to each of them.
- The code reviewer is told "Do not run the test suite or the gate commands" (`factory/prompts/reviewer.md` lines 7-8). The spec writer's example "such as a suite run" would sit badly next to that rule.
- Prototype: I applied the change below in a scratch clone and ran every scenario on base (`b002c95`) and on the prototype. On base: `doc=0 run=0` and `economy=0` for all five roles, changelog `63 CONTIGUOUS` with `terms=2 footer=1`, and scope `extra=0 deleted=0 others=0`. On the prototype every THEN line below printed as written. A mutated prototype (one reworded existing planner line, two words appended to the verifier paragraph, one new file under `agents/`) printed `extra=2 deleted=1 others=1`.
- Harness suite on the prototype: 404 passed, 4 failed. The same 4 tests fail on base in the same clone (`tests/factory/test_instance.py`: `test_init_refused_outside_a_git_work_tree`, `test_command_outside_any_instance_refused_and_writes_nothing`, `test_no_fallback_even_with_a_store_named`, `test_paths_outside_any_instance`; 18 passed, 4 failed on base). The cause is the clone's location inside the store's git checkout, where "outside any git work tree" cannot hold. The change itself does not cause them.
- Tests that read these prompts check that the design block equals its `docs/prompts/` copy (`tests/factory/test_coding_standard.py`, `test_writing_standard.py`, `test_decision_log.py`). One also checks triage's Capabilities line and the 72-character width of its capability lines (`tests/factory/test_capability_index.py` lines 249-259). An added paragraph breaks none of them. The suite run above confirms it.
- The implementer/verifier run-prompt check reuses the fixture in current truth `openspec/specs/role-escalations/spec.md` (scenario "Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule").
- Neither `dev/build-harness.spec.md` nor `README.md` describes the reading rules (`grep -c -i -E 'turn economy|re-sends'` returns 0 for each).

## Root cause

The #73 change (T-0034) scoped the rules to the spec writer and critic, which were the two roles it measured. Its decision log records "No shared preamble line ... which would reach every role, including the implementer and verifier, which the request does not cover." No later ticket added them to the other roles.

## Out of scope

- The spec writer and critic prompts, the shared preamble, the retro and doc-reviewer prompts, and `agents/`.
- Any existing line of the five prompts: no rubric, routing, round limit, required section or output format changes.
- The enforcing hook that refuses whole-file reads and uncapped searches (#76 part B, with #65).
- The replay procedure itself (#80).
- `docs/principles.md` principle 13's "Implemented by" line, which still credits reading rules to #73 only. The operator keeps those status lines up to date (commit `4a34e40`, "statuses updated for #57, #75, #78").
- `README.md` and `dev/build-harness.spec.md`. This change adds no command, state, stop or path, and neither document describes the reading rules.

## Open questions

none

## Decisions

- All five roles get the critic's form of the paragraph, word for word, as one bullet starting `- Turn economy: `. It carries the three reading rules and the sentence saying why they matter. The spec writer's "as few writes as you can" stays out, as the request says. The writer's "such as a suite run" example also stays out, because the code reviewer must not run the suite. With one text, one check covers all five prompts.
- The paragraph goes into each role's own prompt, not into the shared preamble. A preamble line would also reach the spec writer and critic, which already carry the rules, and T-0034 rejected a preamble line for the same reason. The request names the five prompts.
- New lines only: no existing line of any prompt changes. Placement: in the implementer and verifier, a RULES bullet directly before the declared-path bullet, so that bullet stays last under RULES where T-0029 put it. In the code reviewer, the last bullet of WHAT YOU RUN, which is about the commands it runs. In the planner and triage, the last RULES bullet. In triage's run copy, that is before the instance-added "Acceptance items" block.
- Acceptance checks the text each role receives: all three prompt copies and the composed run prompt. The request's own acceptance, the operator replaying past implementer and verifier runs with old and new prompts, is an Operator step. It needs live model runs and a human judgement of verdict quality (as in T-0034 and T-0029).
- `docs/changelog.md` gains entry 64 after entry 63 and before the closing "Declined:" line. The entry cites the #74 replay result as entry 59.

## Risk

Every future run of the five roles reads this paragraph once the runtime moves. The behavioural risk is a role that reads too little. For example, a verifier might tail a suite log and miss a failure printed earlier. The paragraph does not lift the verifier's "Record the actual output" or the implementer's acceptance-result reporting. A role that greps a log still reports what it found. There is a precedent: the #74 replay (changelog entry 59) found that #73's critic rules saved no tokens and made the critic check less. #74 acted on it by removing the cap and the build ban and keeping the reading sentences, but the two were never tested apart. The operator's replay is the check on this risk. A merge into `main` does not change the running harness, so nothing reaches live runs until the operator moves the runtime.

Protected paths: `factory/prompts/implementer.md`, `factory/prompts/verifier.md`, `factory/prompts/reviewer.md`, `factory/prompts/planner.md`, `factory/prompts/triage.md`, `docs/prompts/05-implementer.md`, `docs/prompts/07-verifier.md`, `docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md`, `docs/prompts/04-planner.md`, `docs/prompts/01-triage.md`

## Operator steps

1. After merge and before moving the runtime, replay two or three past build runs of the implementer and verifier with the old and the new prompts, on the same inputs and bases. Compare agent calls, tokens and verdict quality. (#80 tracks the replay procedure.)
2. Only if the replay holds quality, move the runtime checkout to the new harness revision and accept it (`--accept-harness`). If it does not, report the result on #76 and leave the runtime where it is.

=== design.md
## Proposed change

The paragraph, wrapped as a bullet at 72 columns, is exactly:

```
- Turn economy: every turn re-sends everything read so far, so a
  wasted turn or a long printout costs again on every later turn. Put
  independent reads and commands in one turn. Once grep has found the
  lines you need, read that line range, not the whole file. Send long
  output to a file in your scratch directory and grep or tail it,
  rather than printing it in full.
```

A. Implementer and verifier. In `factory/prompts/implementer.md`, `docs/prompts/05-implementer.md` and the "## 5. Implementer" block of `docs/design.md`, insert the paragraph as a RULES bullet directly before the bullet `- A protected path the sub-ticket declares is not an escalation: the`. Do the same in `factory/prompts/verifier.md`, `docs/prompts/07-verifier.md` and the "## 7. Verifier" block.

B. Code reviewer. In `factory/prompts/reviewer.md`, `docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md` and the "## 6. Code reviewer" block, insert the paragraph as the last bullet of WHAT YOU RUN, after the line `  one test or a grep, and cite its output with that finding.`

C. Planner and triage. In `factory/prompts/planner.md`, `docs/prompts/04-planner.md` and the "## 4. Planner / decomposer" block, insert it as the last RULES bullet, after `  siblings to re-verify, so parallel sub-tickets are not free.` In `factory/prompts/triage.md`, `docs/prompts/01-triage.md` and the "## 1. Triage" block, insert it as the last RULES bullet, after `  When unsure between ACCEPT and CLARIFY, choose CLARIFY.` In the run copy, that puts it before the blank line and the "Acceptance items describe behaviour" block.

D. Changelog. Add entry `64. After issue #76 (2026-10-09), ...` directly after entry 63 and before the closing "Declined:" line of `docs/changelog.md`. It says that the implementer, verifier, code reviewer, planner and triage prompts gain #73's three reading rules in the critic's form, without the spec writer's one-write sentence. It cites the #74 replay result (entry 59), says nothing else in the prompts changes and the hook stays with #65, says the runtime moves only after the operator's replay of implementer and verifier runs, and records the rejected preamble line.

The prototype touched 12 files with 91 added lines and none removed.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The implementer, verifier, code reviewer, planner and triage carry the reading rules
Every copy of the implementer, verifier, code reviewer, planner and triage prompts (the `docs/design.md` block, its `docs/prompts/` file and the `factory/prompts/` run copy) SHALL carry the Turn economy paragraph in the critic's words, and MUST NOT carry the spec writer's `as few writes as you can`. Each design block MUST stay byte-identical to its `docs/prompts/` file, and each run copy SHALL differ from it only as it did on `main`.

#### Scenario: The five role prompts carry the critic's reading paragraph in every copy
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); Q=$(printf '\140\140\140'); P='Turn economy: every turn re-sends everything read so far, so a wasted turn or a long printout costs again on every later turn. Put independent reads and commands in one turn. Once grep has found the lines you need, read that line range, not the whole file. Send long output to a file in your scratch directory and grep or tail it, rather than printing it in full.'; for r in "1. Triage|01-triage.md|triage" "4. Planner / decomposer|04-planner.md|planner" "5. Implementer|05-implementer.md|implementer" "6. Code reviewer|06-code-reviewer.md|reviewer" "7. Verifier|07-verifier.md|verifier"; do h=${r%%|*}; x=${r#*|}; c=${x%%|*}; f=${x#*|}; git show main:factory/prompts/$f.md > $T/a; git show main:docs/prompts/$c > $T/b; echo "$f copy=$(awk -v h="## $h" -v q="$Q" '$0==h{s=1;next} s&&$0==q"text"{p=1;next} p&&$0==q{exit} p' docs/design.md | cmp -s - docs/prompts/$c && echo SAME || echo DIFF) doc=$(tr '\n' ' ' < docs/prompts/$c | tr -s ' ' | grep -oF "$P" | grep -c .) run=$(tr '\n' ' ' < factory/prompts/$f.md | tr -s ' ' | grep -oF "$P" | grep -c .) writes=$(cat docs/prompts/$c factory/prompts/$f.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' ' | grep -c 'as few writes as you can') fill=$([ "$(diff factory/prompts/$f.md docs/prompts/$c | grep '^[<>]')" = "$(diff $T/a $T/b | grep '^[<>]')" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly five lines: `triage copy=SAME doc=1 run=1 writes=0 fill=unchanged`, then the same for `planner`, `implementer`, `reviewer` and `verifier`. `copy=SAME`: the design block equals its `docs/prompts/` file. `doc` and `run`: the documented copy and the run copy each carry the whole paragraph once, joined into one line so it may wrap. `writes=0`: neither carries the spec writer's one-write sentence. `fill=unchanged`: the run copy differs from the documented copy only where it did on `main`.

### Requirement: The reading rules are the only change to the role prompts
In the ten `docs/prompts/` and `factory/prompts/` files of the five roles, the lines this change adds SHALL be the paragraph and nothing else, and no existing line SHALL be removed or changed, nor any line of `docs/design.md`. No other file under `docs/prompts/`, `factory/prompts/` or `agents/` SHALL change.

#### Scenario: Only the paragraph is added, and no other prompt changes
- WHEN `(P='Turn economy: every turn re-sends everything read so far, so a wasted turn or a long printout costs again on every later turn. Put independent reads and commands in one turn. Once grep has found the lines you need, read that line range, not the whole file.

- THEN it prints exactly `extra=0 deleted=0 others=0`. `extra` counts the ten files whose added text is anything other than the paragraph. `deleted` counts removed lines in those files and the design doc. `others` counts changed prompt or agent files outside the ten.

### Requirement: Runs of the five roles receive the reading rules
The system prompt that `run start` writes for an implementer, code reviewer, verifier, triage and planner run SHALL contain the Turn economy paragraph once, and MUST NOT contain `as few writes as you can`.

#### Scenario: Implementer, reviewer and verifier runs receive the reading paragraph
Needs the GIVEN block of "Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule" (current truth, role-escalations) run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh && P='Turn economy: every turn re-sends everything read so far, so a wasted turn or a long printout costs again on every later turn. Put independent reads and commands in one turn. Once grep has found the lines you need, read that line range, not the whole file. Send long output to a file in your scratch directory and grep or tail it, rather than printing it in full.'; for r in implementer reviewer verifier; do X=$(prompt $r); echo "$r preamble=$(echo "$X" | grep -c "UNTRUSTED INPUT") economy=$(echo "$X" | grep -cF "$P") writes=$(echo "$X" | grep -c 'as few writes as you can')"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer preamble=1 economy=1 writes=0`, `reviewer preamble=1 economy=1 writes=0`, `verifier preamble=1 economy=1 writes=0`, one per line. `preamble=1` shows the run started and its prompt was read.

#### Scenario: Triage and planner runs receive the reading paragraph
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s; P='Turn economy: every turn re-sends everything read so far, so a wasted turn or a long printout costs again on every later turn. Put independent reads and commands in one turn. Once grep has found the lines you need, read that line range, not the whole file. Send long output to a file in your scratch directory and grep or tail it, rather than printing it in full.'; for i in 1 2; do printf "# F$i\n\nDo x.\n" > $T/req$i.md; bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req$i.md >/dev/null; done; bin/factory ticket set T-0001 status=ready-for-triage >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0002 status=ready-for-planner >/dev/null; bin/factory run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1; bin/factory run start --role planner --ticket T-0002 >/dev/null 2>&1; for r in triage planner; do X=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-$r/system-prompt.txt) | tr -s ' '); echo "$r preamble=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'UNTRUSTED INPUT') economy=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -cF "$P") writes=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'as few writes as you can')"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `triage preamble=1 economy=1 writes=0`, then `planner preamble=1 economy=1 writes=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the reading rules for the five roles
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for issue #76 as its last numbered entry, numbered without a gap, placed before the closing "Declined:" line, naming the five roles and the operator's replay. The change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the reading rules for the five roles as its last entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print n, (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; echo "terms=$(grep '^[0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -oiF -e '#76' -e implementer -e verifier -e 'code reviewer' -e planner -e triage -e replay | tr A-Z a-z | sort -u | grep -c .) footer=$(tail -1 docs/changelog.md | grep -c '^Declined: a dedicated merge agent')")`
- THEN it prints `64 CONTIGUOUS`, then `terms=7 footer=1`

#### Scenario: The reading-rules change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

=== verification.md
## Acceptance

- The five role prompts carry the critic's reading paragraph in every copy → NEW; today each of the five lines prints `doc=0 run=0` (`copy=SAME writes=0 fill=unchanged` already hold), because no copy of these prompts carries the paragraph.
- Only the paragraph is added, and no other prompt changes → REGRESSION; prints `extra=0 deleted=0 others=0` on base and must still after the change. A mutated prototype printed `extra=2 deleted=1 others=1`.
- Implementer, reviewer and verifier runs receive the reading paragraph → NEW; today prints `preamble=1 economy=0 writes=0` for each role. The run starts, but its prompt lacks the paragraph.
- Triage and planner runs receive the reading paragraph → NEW; today prints `triage preamble=1 economy=0 writes=0`, then `planner preamble=1 economy=0 writes=0`.
- The changelog records the reading rules for the five roles as its last entry → NEW; today prints `63 CONTIGUOUS`, then `terms=2 footer=1`, because the last entry is #57's.
- The reading-rules change adds no whitespace errors → REGRESSION; prints `exit=0` on base.

## Responses

- [BLOCKING] 6, Problem first paragraph → FIXED. The Problem now opens with what is wrong and for whom: five of the seven role prompts (triage, planner, implementer, code reviewer, verifier) lack the reading rules that cut the spec writer's tokens by about 37% at the same quality; the operator pays for those tokens on every ticket, and the implementer and verifier pay most because they run suites and long commands. The role gloss follows in the same paragraph. The request's 18% and 13% shares are still left out of the Problem, because I found no source for them in this repo (Evidence bullet 3).
- [SHOULD-FIX] 1, 6, Problem paragraph 2, Evidence bullet 3, Risk → FIXED. Evidence bullet 3 now quotes the other half of changelog entry 59 (`docs/changelog.md` line 63): #73's critic rules "saved nothing (0.71M to 0.72M, 1.0M to 0.93M, 1.67M to 1.63M tokens) and made the critic check less". It also says #73 gave the critic a per-claim cap and a build ban besides the reading paragraph, and that #74 removed the cap and ban and kept "the three reading rules". Problem paragraph 2 says the replay found no critic saving and that the cap was removed while the rules stayed. Risk now names this as the precedent and says the reading sentences and the cap were never tested apart, which is one reason for the operator's replay. Re-checked on `b002c95` (unchanged since round 1): the changelog scenario still prints `63 CONTIGUOUS`, then `terms=2 footer=1`, and `git diff --check main...HEAD` prints `exit=0`.

## Current truth: harness-docs

# harness-docs

## Requirements

### Requirement: The documents record the change
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain entry 51 covering every part, numbered without a gap, `README.md` SHALL describe the new `resolve` behaviour and relative environment paths, and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the change in order
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print n, (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; sed -n '/^51\. /p' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e BLOCKED -e '--replan' -e 'next free' -e 'error text' -e redispatch -e '-whitespace' -e context.md -e relative -e uncommitted | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `51 CONTIGUOUS`, then `9`

#### Scenario: The README describes the new resolve verbs
- WHEN `(echo "replan=$(grep -c -- '--replan' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') gap=$(grep -c 'has no .resolve. verb' README.md)")`
- THEN it prints `replan=1 gap=0`

#### Scenario: The README says relative paths resolve from the caller's directory
- WHEN `(grep -c 'relative .FACTORY_' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')`
- THEN it prints `1`

#### Scenario: The change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the live-store guard
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for this change as its last numbered entry, numbered without a gap; `docs/design.md` SHALL describe the dispatcher marker and the run-directory rule; README's "Where a human decides" SHALL open with the marker's exact command form and say that the refusal deliberately does not name it; README SHALL say the final verifier run is listed as in flight and SHALL no longer say the factory's capabilities never entered the spec store; no prompt copy under `docs/prompts/` or `factory/prompts/` SHALL change; and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the guard as its last entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -oF -e FACTORY_DISPATCH -e 'in flight' -e throwaway -e 'exit 2' -e 'worktrees/' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: The design doc names the marker and the run-directory rule, and no prompt copy changes
- WHEN `(echo "design=$(grep -c FACTORY_DISPATCH docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') dirs=$(grep FACTORY_DISPATCH docs/design.md | grep -c 'worktrees/' | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') prompts=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design=1 dirs=1 prompts=0`

#### Scenario: README tells the operator how to write during a run, first thing under Where a human decides
- WHEN `(H=$(sed -n '/^## Where a human decides/,/^## What is built/p' README.md); J=$(echo "$H" | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "first=$(echo "$H" | sed -n '3p' | grep -c 'FACTORY_DISPATCH=1') command=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 [^ ]*bin/factory ') unnamed=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'deliberately does not name the marker') export=$(echo "$J" | grep -ci 'never export') rundirs=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'worktrees/')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `first=1 command=1 unnamed=1 export=1 rundirs=1`

#### Scenario: README says the final verifier run is listed as in flight
- WHEN `(R=$(tr '\n' ' ' < README.md | tr -s ' '); echo "stale=$(echo "$R" | grep -o 'does not list it as in flight' | grep -c .) listed=$(echo "$R" | grep -o 'lists it as in flight' | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `stale=0 listed=1`

#### Scenario: README no longer says the factory's capabilities never entered the spec store
- WHEN `(echo "bullet=$(grep -c 'Current truth for the factory itself' README.md) stale=$(grep -c 'never entered it' README.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `bullet=1 stale=0`

#### Scenario: The guard change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents describe the store branch
The design doc SHALL name the store branch `factory-store` and the never-tracked path rule, and the build spec SHALL call the store branch only `factory-store`. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one contiguously numbered entry recording the change. `README.md` SHALL describe committing the store on its branch, `factory store migrate`, the `git clean -ffdx` hazard and a checkout from before the move, and SHALL no longer say that a store commit moves the integration branch or give `.factory/state/` as the live store's location. The change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design doc names the store branch and the path rule
- WHEN `(Q=$(printf '\140'); echo "store_branch=$(grep -c 'factory-store' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') tickets_branch=$(grep -c "${Q}tickets${Q} branch" docs/design.md) never_tracked=$(grep -c 'never tracked' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints `store_branch=1 tickets_branch=0 never_tracked=1`

#### Scenario: The build spec calls the store branch factory-store
- WHEN `(Q=$(printf '\140'); echo "old_name=$(grep -c "${Q}tickets${Q}\|refs/heads/tickets\|HEAD:tickets" dev/build-harness.spec.md) new_name=$(grep -c 'factory-store' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints `old_name=0 new_name=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records the store branch in one contiguous entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep -E '^[0-9]+\. ' docs/changelog.md | grep 'factory-store' | grep -c 'never tracked')`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`

#### Scenario: The README describes the store branch and the move
`old_cost` joins the page into one line first, because the retired clause is wrapped across two lines. `old_refs` counts only the places that give the live store's location, so a how-to may still name the path a store moves from.
- WHEN `(Q=$(printf '\140'); echo "store_branch=$(grep -c 'factory-store' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') migrate=$(grep -c 'factory store migrate' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') ffdx=$(grep -c -- '-ffdx' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') premove=$(grep -c 'from before the move' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') old_cost=$(tr '\n' ' ' < README.md | grep -c 'committing the store to the same branch') old_refs=$(grep -c "\.factory/state/\(log\|tickets\)\|(${Q}\.factory/state/${Q})\|at ${Q}\.factory/state/${Q}" README.md)")`
- THEN it prints `store_branch=1 migrate=1 ffdx=1 premove=1 old_cost=0 old_refs=0`

#### Scenario: The store-branch change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The planner labels checks per sub-ticket and may list tests an earlier sibling added
Every copy of the planner prompt (the `docs/design.md` §4 block, `docs/prompts/04-planner.md`, `factory/prompts/planner.md`) SHALL tell the planner to label each check against the sub-ticket's own base, to name interim tests, and to list a sibling-added test as `` `<file>[::<test>]` (added by <sibling ID>): <reason> ``; it MUST no longer say to label checks "the same way", and the design block and its `docs/prompts/` copy SHALL stay byte-identical.

#### Scenario: Every planner copy labels per sub-ticket and lists sibling tests
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-planner.txt; sed -n '/^## 4\. Planner/,/^## 5\. /p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/04-planner.md factory/prompts/planner.md; do echo "own=$(grep -c "against this sub-ticket's own base" $f) sibling=$(grep -cF '(added by <sibling ID>)' $f) interim=$(grep -c '^  Interim tests: ' $f) copied=$(grep -c 'labelled NEW or REGRESSION the same way' $f)"; done; cmp -s $X docs/prompts/04-planner.md && echo verbatim || echo differs)`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `own=1 sibling=1 interim=1 copied=0`, then `verbatim`

### Requirement: The spec writer lists the tests a decision overturns, and the critic checks for one left off
Every copy of the spec writer prompt SHALL carry the RULES bullet that starts `- Tests a decision overturns: `, and every copy of the critic prompt SHALL say under rubric 1 that a test pinning the old behaviour and `missing from "Tests to change" is a finding`.

#### Scenario: Every spec writer and critic copy carries the decision-overturns rule
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-sw.txt; for h in '2\. Spec writer' '3\. Spec critic'; do sed -n "/^## $h/,/^## [0-9]/p" docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p"; done > $X; echo "design: writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' $X) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' $X)"; echo "docs/prompts: writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md)"; echo "factory/prompts: writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' factory/prompts/spec_writer.md) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' factory/prompts/critic.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design: writer=1 critic=1`, then `docs/prompts: writer=1 critic=1`, then `factory/prompts: writer=1 critic=1`

### Requirement: The preamble and the code reviewer accept a checked sibling entry
Every copy of the preamble SHALL allow an existing test listed `in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling`, and every copy of the code reviewer prompt SHALL not block a test `the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling`.

#### Scenario: Every preamble and reviewer copy accepts a sibling entry
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-pr.txt; for h in 'Shared preamble' '6\. Code reviewer'; do sed -n "/^## $h/,/^## [0-9A-Z]/p" docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p"; done > $X; echo "design: guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' $X) review=$(grep -c 'or the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling' $X)"; echo "docs/prompts: guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' docs/prompts/00-preamble.md) review=$(grep -c 'or the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling' docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md)"; echo "factory/prompts: guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' factory/prompts/preamble.md) review=$(grep -c 'or the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling' factory/prompts/reviewer.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design: guard=1 review=1`, then `docs/prompts: guard=1 review=1`, then `factory/prompts: guard=1 review=1`

### Requirement: Role runs receive the new rules
The system prompt that `run start` writes for a planner, spec writer and critic run SHALL contain that role's new rule and the new preamble sentence.

#### Scenario: Planner, spec writer and critic runs get the new rules in their system prompts
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s; for i in 1 2 3; do printf "# F$i\n\nDo x.\n" > $T/req$i.md; bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req$i.md >/dev/null; done; bin/factory ticket set T-0001 status=ready-for-planner >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0002 status=ready-for-spec-writer >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0003 status=ready-for-critic >/dev/null; for p in planner:T-0001 spec_writer:T-0002 critic:T-0003; do bin/factory run start --role ${p%%:*} --ticket ${p##*:} >/dev/null 2>&1; done; P=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-planner/system-prompt.txt); W=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-spec_writer/system-prompt.txt); C=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-critic/system-prompt.txt); echo "planner own=$(grep -c "against this sub-ticket's own base" $P) sibling=$(grep -cF '(added by <sibling ID>)' $P) guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' $P) writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' $W) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' $C)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `planner own=1 sibling=1 guard=1 writer=1 critic=1`

### Requirement: The documents record the sibling-tests check
`docs/design.md` SHALL describe the check in a paragraph that starts `**Tests a sibling added.**`, in piece 8 and in the spec approval gate row, and SHALL no longer call the gate's list the only authorization to alter an existing test; `dev/build-harness.spec.md` SHALL name the `BLOCKED from harness` refusal; `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain an entry for issue #40 and stay numbered without a gap; `README.md` SHALL describe the check and the new `--ruling` case; and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design doc and build spec describe the check
- WHEN `(echo "piece8=$(grep '^| 8 |' docs/design.md | grep -c 'added by that sibling') gate=$(grep '^| Spec approval |' docs/design.md | grep -c 'a test an earlier sibling added') stale=$(grep -c 'which is the only authorization to alter an existing test' docs/design.md) check=$(grep -c '^\*\*Tests a sibling added\.\*\*.*BLOCKED from harness:' docs/design.md) build=$(grep -c 'BLOCKED from harness' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `piece8=1 gate=1 stale=0 check=1 build=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records issue 40's change without a numbering gap
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #40 ' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e 'own base' -e 'added by' -e 'BLOCKED from harness' -e 'Decision' -e 'critic rubric 1' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: README describes the sibling tests check and its ruling
- WHEN `(echo "built=$(grep -c '^- \*\*Sibling tests check\.\*\*' README.md) ruling=$(grep '^| \*\*Unstick\*\*' README.md | grep -c 'a test no merged sibling added')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `built=1 ruling=1`

#### Scenario: The sibling-tests change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the declared-path rule
The "## 5. Implementer" and "## 7. Verifier" blocks of `docs/design.md` SHALL carry the declared-path rule and stay verbatim copies of `docs/prompts/05-implementer.md` and `docs/prompts/07-verifier.md`. The run copies under `factory/prompts/` SHALL differ from those files only by the fills they had on `main`. The code reviewer and preamble copies MUST NOT change. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for issue #49, numbered without a gap, and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design blocks and their copies carry the rule and stay in step
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); Q=$(printf '\140\140\140'); for r in "5. Implementer|05-implementer.md|implementer" "7. Verifier|07-verifier.md|verifier"; do h=${r%%|*}; x=${r#*|}; c=${x%%|*}; f=${x#*|}; git show main:factory/prompts/$f.md > $T/a; git show main:docs/prompts/$c > $T/b; echo "$f copy=$(awk -v h="## $h" -v q="$Q" '$0==h{s=1;next} s&&$0==q"text"{p=1;next} p&&$0==q{exit} p' docs/design.md | cmp -s - docs/prompts/$c && echo SAME || echo DIFF) rule=$(tr '\n' ' ' < docs/prompts/$c | tr -s ' ' | grep -c 'A protected path the sub-ticket declares is not an escalation') fill=$([ "$(diff factory/prompts/$f.md docs/prompts/$c | grep '^[<>]')" = "$(diff $T/a $T/b | grep '^[<>]')" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer copy=SAME rule=1 fill=unchanged`, then `verifier copy=SAME rule=1 fill=unchanged`. `copy=SAME`: the design block equals its `docs/prompts/` file. `rule=1`: that file carries the rule. `fill=unchanged`: the run copy under `factory/prompts/` differs from the documented copy only where it did on `main`.

#### Scenario: The code reviewer and preamble copies do not change
- WHEN `(echo "changed=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- factory/prompts/reviewer.md factory/prompts/preamble.md docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md docs/prompts/00-preamble.md | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `changed=0`

#### Scenario: The changelog records the declared-path rule in a contiguous entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep -E '^[0-9]+\. ' docs/changelog.md | grep -F '#49' | grep -c 'ESCALATIONS')`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`

#### Scenario: The declared-path change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the small-change lane
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for this change as its last numbered entry, numbered without a gap. `docs/design.md`, `dev/build-harness.spec.md` and `README.md` SHALL describe the whole-spec sub-ticket and gate-command paths. No prompt copy SHALL change, and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the small-change lane as its last entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -oF -e 'paths' -e SKIPPED -e 'plan whole-spec' -e NEEDS-SPLIT -e seams | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: The design doc, build spec and README describe both skips, and no prompt copy changes
- WHEN `(echo "design=$(grep -c 'whole-spec' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') gate=$(grep '^| 11 | Gate runner' docs/design.md | grep -c 'SKIPPED') build=$(grep -c 'plan whole-spec' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') readme=$(grep -c 'plan whole-spec' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') skipped=$(grep -c 'SKIPPED' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') stale=$(grep -c 'The build workflow runs the planner, which' README.md) prompts=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts agents | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design=1 gate=1 build=1 readme=1 skipped=1 stale=0 prompts=0`

#### Scenario: The small-change lane adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: Every role is told to wait for its own commands
Every copy of the shared preamble SHALL carry the bullet that starts `- Run every command in the foreground and wait for it to finish.` and says `Never end your turn while a command you started is still running`. The design block and both files MUST stay byte-identical, and every role run's system prompt SHALL carry the bullet.

#### Scenario: Every preamble copy carries the wait rule and the copies stay identical
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-pre.txt; sed -n '/^## Shared preamble/,/^## [0-9]/p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/00-preamble.md factory/prompts/preamble.md; do echo "fg=$(grep -c '^- Run every command in the foreground and wait for it to finish\.$' $f) end=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $f | tr -s ' ' | grep -c 'Never end your turn while a command you started is still running')"; done; cmp -s $X docs/prompts/00-preamble.md && cmp -s docs/prompts/00-preamble.md factory/prompts/preamble.md && echo verbatim || echo differs)`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `fg=1 end=1`, then `verbatim`

#### Scenario: Implementer, reviewer and verifier run prompts carry the wait rule, and only the reviewer's carries the judge-the-diff rule
Needs the GIVEN block of "Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh && for r in implementer reviewer verifier; do P=$(prompt $r); echo "$r fg=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'Never end your turn while a command you started is still running') judge=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'Do not run the test suite or the gate commands')"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer fg=1 judge=0`, `reviewer fg=1 judge=1`, `verifier fg=1 judge=0`, one per line

### Requirement: The code reviewer judges the diff and leaves the suite and the gate to the verifier
Every copy of the code reviewer prompt SHALL say `Do not run the test suite or the gate commands: the verifier runs them on the same head`, and SHALL allow a narrow command that confirms a specific finding. No existing line of that prompt MAY be removed, and the verifier prompt MUST NOT change. The reviewer's composed input MUST NOT list the gate commands, while the implementer's and the verifier's inputs still SHALL.

#### Scenario: Every reviewer copy carries the rule, keeps every existing line, and the verifier prompt is unchanged
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-rev.txt; T=$(mktemp -d); sed -n '/^## 6\. Code reviewer/,/^## 7\. /p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md factory/prompts/reviewer.md; do J=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $f | tr -s ' '); echo "judge=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'Do not run the test suite or the gate commands: the verifier runs them on the same head') narrow=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'You may run a narrow command to confirm a specific finding')"; done; git show main:factory/prompts/reviewer.md > $T/a; git show main:docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md > $T/b; echo "copy=$(cmp -s $X docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md && echo SAME || echo DIFF) fill=$([ "$(diff factory/prompts/reviewer.md docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md | grep '^[<>]')" = "$(diff $T/a $T/b | grep '^[<>]')" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed) removed=$(git diff main...HEAD -- docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md factory/prompts/reviewer.md | grep -v '^---' | grep -c '^-') verifier_changed=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts/07-verifier.md factory/prompts/verifier.md | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `judge=1 narrow=1`, then `copy=SAME fill=unchanged removed=0 verifier_changed=0`

#### Scenario: The reviewer's input no longer hands it the gate commands, and the implementer's and verifier's still do
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "A reviewer that ends its turn waiting on its own commands is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT beside the verifier's passing rows" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-checks.sh && for r in reviewer verifier implementer; do [ $r = implementer ] && bin/factory ticket set T-0001.1 status=ready-for-implementer 'in_flight=[]' >/dev/null; R=$(bin/factory run start --role $r --ticket T-0001.1 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'); bin/factory run compose ${R:-none} >/dev/null 2>&1; I=$FACTORY_STATE/runs/${R:-none}/input.md; echo "$r gates=$(grep -c 'Gate commands (run each from your worktree' $I 2>/dev/null) told=$(grep -c 'The verifier runs the gate commands on this head; you do not run them' $I 2>/dev/null)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `reviewer gates=0 told=1`, `verifier gates=1 told=0`, `implementer gates=1 told=0`, one per line

### Requirement: The documents record the empty-output route
`docs/design.md` SHALL state the EMPTY-OUTPUT rule and its two routing-table rows, and SHALL list a second EMPTY-OUTPUT among the park reasons. `dev/build-harness.spec.md` SHALL describe EMPTY-OUTPUT and `run last-message`, and SHALL no longer describe a KILLED condition or seam. `README.md` SHALL no longer say that a run is parked for exceeding a budget, and SHALL describe the empty-output retry. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain an entry for issue #41, numbered without a gap. The change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design doc states the EMPTY-OUTPUT rule, its rows and its park
- WHEN `(echo "rule=$(grep -c '^- A role run that ends without writing its output is EMPTY-OUTPUT' docs/design.md) rows=$(grep -c '^| Any role | EMPTY-OUTPUT' docs/design.md) parks=$(grep '^- A non-empty ESCALATIONS line' docs/design.md | grep -c 'a second EMPTY-OUTPUT in a row') kill=$(grep -c 'never recorded as a budget kill' docs/design.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `rule=1 rows=2 parks=1 kill=1`

#### Scenario: The build spec describes EMPTY-OUTPUT and no longer a KILLED condition
- WHEN `(echo "stale=$(grep -c 'KILLED condition\|KILLED seam' dev/build-harness.spec.md) empty=$(grep -c 'EMPTY-OUTPUT' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') note=$(grep -c 'run last-message' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `stale=0 empty=1 note=1`

#### Scenario: README drops the budget park and describes the empty-output retry
- WHEN `(echo "budget=$(grep -c 'exceeding its budget\|over budget' README.md) built=$(grep -c '^- \*\*Empty output\.\*\*' README.md) unstick=$(grep '^| \*\*Unstick\*\*' README.md | grep -c 'ended without output twice')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `budget=0 built=1 unstick=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records issue 41 without a numbering gap
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #41 ' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e EMPTY-OUTPUT -e foreground -e 'last message' -e 're-dispatched once' -e 'gate commands' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: The empty-output change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The spec writer and the critic carry the turn-economy rules
Every copy of the spec writer prompt SHALL tell it to batch independent reads and commands, read line ranges once grep has found them, keep long output in a scratch file, and write the spec in as few writes as it can. Every copy of the critic prompt SHALL carry the same reading rules, its minimum spot-check, a rule that it runs no test suite, the rule for picking an acceptance command, a sentence allowing a small experiment in its scratch directory to confirm a finding, and the rule that turns a claim needing a suite run or a build of the change into a finding or a question; it MUST NOT cap a claim at a number of paths and commands or forbid a clone, worktree or prototype. Each design block MUST stay byte-identical to its `docs/prompts/` copy, and each run copy SHALL differ from it only as it did on `main`.

#### Scenario: Every critic copy drops the cap and the no-build rule and keeps the rest; every writer copy keeps its rules
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); Q=$(printf '\140\140\140'); printf '%s\n' 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn' 'read that line range, not the whole file' 'to a file in your scratch directory and grep or tail it' > $T/both; { cat $T/both; echo 'Write the spec in as few writes as you can'; } > $T/spec_writer; { cat $T/both; printf '%s\n' 'Spot-check at least 2 cited paths and 1 acceptance command yourself' 'Run no test suite' 'Pick an acceptance command that runs no test suite' 'small experiment in your scratch directory' 'is a finding for the writer, or a question'; } > $T/critic; printf '%s\n' 'Ground any one claim' 'build nothing' 'no clone, worktree or prototype' > $T/gone; for r in "2.

- THEN it prints exactly `spec_writer copy=SAME doc=4/4 run=4/4 gone=0 fill=unchanged`, then `critic copy=SAME doc=8/8 run=8/8 gone=0 fill=unchanged`. `doc` and `run` count the kept or added phrases found in the documented copy and the run copy, each joined into one line so a phrase may wrap; `gone` counts the removed phrases found in either.

### Requirement: Spec writer and critic runs receive the turn-economy rules
The system prompt that `run start` writes for a spec writer run SHALL contain the writer's turn-economy rule. The one it writes for a critic run SHALL contain the critic's reading rules, its no-suite rule and the sentence allowing a small scratch experiment, and MUST NOT contain the per-claim cap or the no-build rule.

#### Scenario: A critic run's prompt has the no-suite rule and the scratch allowance, and no cap or build ban
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s; for i in 1 2; do printf "# F$i\n\nDo x.\n" > $T/req$i.md; bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req$i.md >/dev/null; done; bin/factory ticket set T-0001 status=ready-for-spec-writer >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0002 status=ready-for-critic >/dev/null; bin/factory run start --role spec_writer --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1; bin/factory run start --role critic --ticket T-0002 >/dev/null 2>&1; W=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $FACTORY_STATE/runs/run-0001-spec_writer/system-prompt.txt | tr -s ' '); C=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $FACTORY_STATE/runs/run-0002-critic/system-prompt.txt | tr -s ' '); echo "spec_writer batch=$(printf "%s" "$W" | grep -c 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn') writes=$(printf "%s" "$W" | grep -c 'Write the spec in as few writes as you can')"; echo "critic batch=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn') suite=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Run no test suite') scratch=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'small experiment in your scratch directory') cap=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Ground any one claim') build=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'build nothing')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `spec_writer batch=1 writes=1`, then `critic batch=1 suite=1 scratch=1 cap=0 build=0`

### Requirement: Nothing else in the two prompts changes
The spec writer prompt copies SHALL stay as #73 left them at `05cf8f9`. In the critic prompt copies, everything before the PROCESS section and everything from ANTI-GOODHARTING on SHALL stay byte for byte as on `main`. No other file under `docs/prompts/`, `factory/prompts/` or `agents/` SHALL change.

#### Scenario: The writer prompt is as #73 left it, and only the critic's PROCESS changes
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); n=0; for x in "docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md|1,/^PROCESS\$/p" "docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md|/^ANTI-GOODHARTING/,\$p" "factory/prompts/critic.md|1,/^PROCESS\$/p" "factory/prompts/critic.md|/^ANTI-GOODHARTING/,\$p"; do f=${x%%|*}; s=${x#*|}; git show main:$f | sed -n "$s" > $T/a; sed -n "$s" $f > $T/b; [ -s $T/a ] || n=$((n+100)); cmp -s $T/a $T/b || { n=$((n+1)); echo "changed: $f $s"; }; done; echo "sections_changed=$n writer=$(git diff --name-only 05cf8f9 HEAD -- docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md factory/prompts/spec_writer.md | grep -c .) others=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts agents | grep -vxF -e docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md -e factory/prompts/critic.md | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints only `sections_changed=0 writer=0 others=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the turn-economy change
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #73, numbered without a gap. `docs/principles.md` principle 2 SHALL name the critic's no-suite rule among its mechanisms, SHALL no longer say the critic builds nothing, and SHALL say part B.2 is done by #41 for the code reviewer and by #73 for the critic.

#### Scenario: Principle 2 names the critic's no-suite rule and no longer its build ban
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; P=$(sed -n '/^### 2\. /,/^### 3\. /p' docs/principles.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "entries73=$(grep -c '^[0-9]*\. After issue #73 ' docs/changelog.md) implemented=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'runs no test suite (#73') builds=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'builds nothing') status=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'done by #41 for the code reviewer and by #73 for the critic')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `CONTIGUOUS`, then `entries73=1 implemented=1 builds=0 status=1`

### Requirement: The documents record the critic revert
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for issue #74 as its last numbered entry, numbered without a gap, that records the replay result and the two removed rules. The Spiking section of `docs/principles.md` SHALL no longer bound the critic to two paths and one command or say it does not build, SHALL say the critic may run a small scratch check, SHALL say vetting a whole approach belongs to the spec writer or a spike, and SHALL record the replay. The change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the revert as its last entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -oF -e '#74' -e replay -e 'per-claim cap' -e 'no-build rule' -e 'no test suite' -e UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR -e brace-list | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `7`

#### Scenario: The Spiking section allows a small scratch check and records the replay
- WHEN `(X=$(sed -n '/^## Spiking/,$p' docs/principles.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "bound=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'two paths, one command') nobuild=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'it does not build') scratch=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'small scratch check') whole=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'vetting a whole approach belongs to the spec writer') replay=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'replay')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `bound=0 nobuild=0 scratch=1 whole=1 replay=1`

#### Scenario: The critic revert adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the capability index
The triage prompt's design block, its `docs/prompts/` copy and the runtime prompt SHALL each carry the `Capabilities:` output line. `docs/design.md`, `dev/build-harness.spec.md` and the README's Triage, Spec writer and Spec critic rows MUST describe the capability index. `docs/changelog.md` MUST have an entry for issue #75, with no whitespace error in the change.

#### Scenario: The prompt copies, design, build spec, README and changelog name the capability index
- WHEN `(echo "docs-copy=$(grep -c '^Capabilities:' docs/prompts/01-triage.md) runtime=$(grep -c '^Capabilities:' factory/prompts/triage.md) changelog=$(grep -c '^[0-9]*\. After issue #75 ' docs/changelog.md) design=$(grep -q 'capability index' docs/design.md && echo y || echo n) build-spec=$(grep -q 'capability index' dev/build-harness.spec.md && echo y || echo n) readme=$(grep -E '^\| (Triage|Spec writer|Spec critic) \(' README.md | grep -c 'capability index')"; git diff --check main...HEAD && echo whitespace=ok)`
- THEN it prints exactly `docs-copy=1 runtime=1 changelog=1 design=y build-spec=y readme=3`, then `whitespace=ok`

### Requirement: The documents describe the whole decision log for the spec writer, critic and planner
`docs/design.md` and the README's Spec writer, Spec critic and Planner rows MUST say that those roles receive the whole decision log, and neither MUST mention a decision index. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL have an entry for issue #78, with no whitespace error in the change.

#### Scenario: The design, README and changelog describe the whole decision log and no decision index
- WHEN `(echo "design-index=$(grep -c 'decision index' docs/design.md) design-whole=$(grep -c 'They and the planner receive the whole decision log' docs/design.md) readme-index=$(grep -c 'decision index' README.md) readme-whole=$(grep -E '^\| (Spec writer|Spec critic|Planner) \(' README.md | grep -c 'the whole decision log') changelog=$(grep -c '^[0-9]*\. After issue #78 ' docs/changelog.md)"; git diff --check main...HEAD && echo whitespace=ok)`
- THEN it prints exactly `design-index=0 design-whole=1 readme-index=0 readme-whole=3 changelog=1`, then `whitespace=ok`

### Requirement: The documents record superseded plans
`docs/design.md` SHALL say, in its rule for a sub-ticket closed by the human, that a new plan from a later approved version supersedes the earlier plan's unmerged sub-tickets. `dev/build-harness.spec.md` SHALL describe the `superseded` list of `ready-implementers`. `README.md` SHALL carry a "Re-plan after a re-spec" bullet. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #77, numbered without a gap. The change MUST NOT touch any prompt copy, workflow script or agent template, and MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design doc, build spec, README and changelog record superseded plans
- WHEN `(echo "design=$(grep 'sub-ticket closed by the human' docs/design.md | grep -c supersede) build-spec=$(grep 'ready-implementers PARENT' dev/build-harness.spec.md | grep -c superseded) readme=$(grep -c '^- \*\*Re-plan after a re-spec\.\*\*' README.md) changelog=$(grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #77 ' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e superseded -e planned_from -e 'Depends on' | sort -u | grep -c .) $(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design=1 build-spec=1 readme=1 changelog=3 CONTIGUOUS`

#### Scenario: The superseded-plan change leaves prompts, workflows and agents alone and adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(echo "whitespace=$(git diff --check main...HEAD >/dev/null && echo ok || echo bad) untouched=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts factory/workflows agents | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `whitespace=ok untouched=0`

### Requirement: The prompts tell the reviewer what the gate checks and the spec writer how to declare
Every copy of the code reviewer prompt (the `docs/design.md` §6 block, `docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md`, `factory/prompts/reviewer.md`) SHALL carry check 6's new last sentence and MUST NOT say `will require a human approval`. Every copy of the spec writer prompt SHALL give the `Protected paths:` line under Risk and the rule of one path or glob per entry with no brace lists. Each design block and its `docs/prompts/` file MUST stay byte-identical, and each `factory/prompts/` copy SHALL differ from its `docs/prompts/` file only where it did on `main`.

#### Scenario: Every reviewer prompt copy states what the merge gate checks
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0033-rev.txt; T=$(mktemp -d); sed -n '/^## 6\. Code reviewer/,/^## 7\. /p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md factory/prompts/reviewer.md; do J=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $f | tr -s ' '); echo "gate=$(echo "$J" | grep -c "The merge gate merges a path the approved spec's Risk section declares with no further approval, and refuses and parks one it does not declare") promise=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'will require a human approval')"; done; git show main:factory/prompts/reviewer.md > $T/a; git show main:docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md > $T/b; echo "copy=$(cmp -s $X docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md && echo SAME || echo DIFF) fill=$([ "$(diff factory/prompts/reviewer.md docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md | grep '^[<>]')" = "$(diff $T/a $T/b | grep '^[<>]')" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)")`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `gate=1 promise=0`, then `copy=SAME fill=unchanged`

#### Scenario: Every spec writer prompt copy gives the declaration line
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0033-sw.txt; T=$(mktemp -d); sed -n '/^## 2\. Spec writer/,/^## 3\. /p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md factory/prompts/spec_writer.md; do echo "reads=$(grep -c 'declared on one line the merge gate reads:$' $f) form=$(grep -c '^ *Protected paths: none | .<path or glob>., .<path or glob>.$' $f) braces=$(grep -c '^ *one path or glob per entry, no brace lists$' $f)"; done; git show main:factory/prompts/spec_writer.md > $T/a; git show main:docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md > $T/b; echo "copy=$(cmp -s $X docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md && echo SAME || echo DIFF) fill=$([ "$(diff factory/prompts/spec_writer.md docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md | grep '^[<>]')" = "$(diff $T/a $T/b | grep '^[<>]')" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)")`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `reads=1 form=1 braces=1`, then `copy=SAME fill=unchanged`

### Requirement: The documents record the protected-path rule at merge
`docs/design.md` SHALL drop the per-PR approval for protected paths, describe the declared-path rule in piece 8 and the Protected paths gate row, and route a reviewer ESCALATE back to its checks; `dev/build-harness.spec.md` SHALL describe the same rule; `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain an entry for issue #57 and stay numbered without a gap; `README.md` SHALL describe the check and `--accept-paths`; and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design doc and build spec drop the per-PR approval for protected paths
- WHEN `(echo "gates=$(grep -c 'a PR touching a protected path, the daily escalation queue' docs/design.md) either=$(grep -c 'A change to either needs a human approval record before it merges' docs/design.md) onpr=$(grep -c 'any other guardrail or protected path needs a human approval on the PR itself' docs/design.md) piece8=$(grep '^| 8 |' docs/design.md | grep -c 'Protected paths:') piece9=$(grep -c 'review protected PRs' docs/design.md) gaterow=$(grep '^| Protected paths |' docs/design.md | grep -c -- '--accept-paths') stale=$(grep -c 'records the piece-8 approval; the merge gate does not merge without it' docs/design.md) reviewer_rule=$(grep -c '^  - A reviewer ESCALATE returns to its checks' docs/design.md) old_route=$(grep -c 'or a reviewer ESCALATE returns to the implementer' docs/design.md) build=$(grep -c 'protected path pyproject.toml needs human approval on H' dev/build-harness.spec.md) build_new=$(grep '^25\. ' dev/build-harness.spec.md | grep -c 'not declared')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `gates=0 either=0 onpr=0 piece8=1 piece9=0 gaterow=1 stale=0 reviewer_rule=1 old_route=0 build=0 build_new=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records issue 57's change without a numbering gap
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #57 ' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e 'Risk' -e '--accept-paths' -e 'BLOCKED from merge gate' -e 'checks' -e 'Protected paths:' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: README describes the protected-path check and the new resolve verb
- WHEN `(echo "built=$(grep -c '^- \*\*Protected paths at merge\.\*\*' README.md) unstick=$(grep '^| \*\*Unstick\*\*' README.md | grep -c -- '--accept-paths') merges=$(sed -n '/^- \*\*Merges, one at a time\.\*\*/,/^- \*\*Setting up the store\.\*\*/p' README.md | grep -c 'Risk section' | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `built=1 unstick=1 merges=1`

#### Scenario: The protected-path change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

## Current truth: role-escalations

# role-escalations

## Requirements

### Requirement: The implementer and verifier leave declared protected paths out of ESCALATIONS
The system prompt of every implementer and verifier run SHALL say that a protected path the sub-ticket declares is not an escalation, that the code reviewer lists declared paths once for each head it reviews, that the role may name them but not under ESCALATIONS, and that a protected path the sub-ticket does not declare still goes under ESCALATIONS.

#### Scenario: Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the fixture file written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

```sh
cat > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh <<'EOF'
# Sourced from the repo root of the checkout under test. Defines `prompt <role>`: starts one run of
# that role (implementer, reviewer or verifier) on a scratch target with a throwaway store, and
# prints the run's system prompt on one line, runs of spaces squeezed.
T29=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B29=$PWD/bin/factory
git init -q -b main $T29/tgt && git -C $T29/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init
(cd $T29/tgt && $B29 init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1)
printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T29/req.md
(cd $T29/tgt && FACTORY_STATE=$T29/s $B29 ticket new --file $T29/req.md >/dev/null)
prompt() (
  cd $T29/tgt && export FACTORY_STATE=$T29/s
  case $1 in
    implementer) $B29 ticket set T-0001 status=ready-for-implementer 'in_flight=[]' >/dev/null ;;
    *) $B29 ticket set T-0001 status=checks-in-flight 'in_flight=[]' head=$(git rev-parse HEAD) >/dev/null ;;
  esac
  R=$($B29 run start --role $1 --ticket T-0001 --model opus 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
  tr '\n' ' ' < $T29/s/runs/${R:-none}/system-prompt.txt 2>/dev/null | tr -s ' '
)
EOF
```

- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh && for r in implementer verifier; do P=$(prompt $r); echo "$r declared=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'A protected path the sub-ticket declares is not an escalation') notunder=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'but not under ESCALATIONS') undeclared=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'still goes under ESCALATIONS when the sub-ticket does not declare it')"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer declared=1 notunder=1 undeclared=1`, then `verifier declared=1 notunder=1 undeclared=1`

### Requirement: Every role still escalates an undeclared protected path, and the code reviewer still lists declared ones
The system prompts of implementer, code reviewer and verifier runs MUST still carry the preamble's rule to escalate a protected path that the approved spec's Risk section does not declare. The code reviewer's prompt MUST still carry check 6's rule to ESCALATE a path the sub-ticket does not declare and to list a declared one under ESCALATIONS. Check 6 SHALL say that the merge gate merges a path the approved spec's Risk section declares with no further approval, and SHALL NOT promise a human approval at merge.

#### Scenario: All three run prompts keep the undeclared-path rule and the reviewer keeps check 6
Needs the GIVEN block of "Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule" (current truth, role-escalations) run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh && u="a protected path the approved spec's Risk section does not declare"; for r in implementer reviewer verifier; do echo "$r undeclared=$(prompt $r | grep -cF "$u")"; done; echo "check6=$(prompt reviewer | grep -cF '6. Protected paths touched? If the sub-ticket does not declare them, ESCALATE. If it does, list them under ESCALATIONS')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer undeclared=1`, `reviewer undeclared=1`, `verifier undeclared=1`, `check6=1`, one per line

#### Scenario: The reviewer run prompt says what the merge gate checks
Needs the GIVEN block of "Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule" (current truth, role-escalations) run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh && P=$(prompt reviewer); echo "gate=$(echo "$P" | grep -c "The merge gate merges a path the approved spec's Risk section declares with no further approval") promise=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'will require a human approval')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `gate=1 promise=0`

## Capability index: current truth not given in full above

This list is complete: every current-truth capability not given in full above has one line here. Open a capability at its path before you rely on it. A spec that cites a capability's path, as `openspec/specs/<name>/spec.md`, sends that capability in full to the critic, so cite under Evidence each capability you open.

- build-dispatch, 31 kB, `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/openspec/specs/build-dispatch/spec.md`: A park reason carries the failing command's error; The build runs only the checkers a commit still needs; The workflows' clerk commands carry the dispatcher marker; An implementer starts only when each sibling-added test it may change came from a merged sibling; The build parks a harness-blocked sub-ticket as BLOCKED, so a ruling returns it; The build asks the whole-spec step before it runs the planner; A role run that leaves no output is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT; A role run that writes its output runs once and routes on its STATUS; The build counts only the current plan's sub-tickets; A parent's final check and close count only the current plan's sub-tickets; The build parks a merge the gate blocked, with the gate's reason
- gate-commands, 9 kB, `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/openspec/specs/gate-commands/spec.md`: A gate command may declare its paths and is skipped for a sub-ticket that touches none of them; A skipped command is recorded on the gate result, and the merge still needs that result to pass; The implementer is given every gate command; A malformed gate entry refuses every build role's run start
- harness-suite, 2 kB, `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/openspec/specs/harness-suite/spec.md`: The harness suite runs mid-edit without loosening the lock
- human-resolution, 18 kB, `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/openspec/specs/human-resolution/spec.md`: A ruling returns a BLOCKED sub-ticket to its implementer; Existing ruling routes are unchanged; A re-plan returns a fully merged parent to its planner; A redispatch sets aside only rows that did not pass; Accepting the refused paths returns the sub-ticket to its checks, which then merge; A ruling on a merge gate's refusal sends the sub-ticket back to its implementer; A ruling on a reviewer's escalation returns the sub-ticket to its checks
- live-store-guard, 13 kB, `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/openspec/specs/live-store-guard/spec.md`: Unmarked writes to a live store are refused while a role run is in flight there; Writes from inside a store's run directories or code checkouts are refused, marked or not; Reads, marked commands from outside the store, throwaway stores and idle stores stay open; The marker does not lift the harness lock
- merge-gate, 9 kB, `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/store/openspec/specs/merge-gate/spec.md`: A store commit does not hold back a merge; A commit to the integration branch still holds back a merge; The merge gate refuses a changed protected path the pinned spec does not declare; A declared or unprotected path merges with no further approval

## Decision log (decisions.md): standing decisions, read-only

2026-10-04 T-0023 `resolve --ruling F` also accepts a park whose reason starts with `BLOCKED`. It writes F as the next `approvals/<id>/ruling-<n>.md` and returns the sub-ticket to `ready-for-implementer` at the same round.
2026-10-04 T-0023 `resolve PARENT --replan F` moves a parked parent whose sub-tickets have all merged to `ready-for-planner`, with F as its next ruling. The planner receives F and plans the fix. Rejected: the requester's `--replan --file <plan>` straight to `planned`. It needs a new routing edge, which the queue policy does not count as small. It would also skip the planner. `dev/build-harness.spec.md` already sends a re-plan through the planner.
2026-10-04 T-0023 On a re-plan, the planner's input lists the parent's existing sub-tickets, each with its title and state. The human's note F therefore needs to say only what to fix. Rejected: asking the human to restate in F what has merged, which the store already knows.
2026-10-04 T-0023 Sub-tickets that a later plan adds take the next free ids under the parent, and their `Depends on:` lines may name the parent's existing sub-tickets. A plan head line that reuses an existing sub-ticket's id is refused. Rejected: honouring explicit non-colliding ids, a second numbering rule that the planner's free-form ids would make ambiguous.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A park reason is never blank. When the clerk relays an empty stderr, the workflows use the refusal's JSON `error`, and failing that `exit <n>, no JSON on stdout` or `exit <n>, no error text`. Rejected: editing each of the 26 reason sites.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A redispatch sets aside a checker's rows only when they did not pass. The reviewer's row is kept when it is `APPROVE`. The verifier and gate rows are kept together when they are `VERIFIED` and `PASS`, because one verifier run writes both. The build then runs only the checkers with no row on that commit. After an implementer run it still runs both. Rejected: a `--roles` flag on redispatch, which no reported case needs.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The store gets a `.gitattributes` holding `runs/** -whitespace`. `init` and every `run start` write it the way they already write `.gitignore`. Rejected: rewriting committed records, and excluding the store path inside each gate command.
2026-10-04 T-0023 `init` refuses, with exit 2 and nothing written, to create an instance while `FACTORY_STATE` names another store. A compose with no `context.md` refuses with exit 2. Rejected: writing every instance piece from a throwaway-store `init`. That contradicts the rule that such a run initialises only that store.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A relative `FACTORY_INSTANCE`, `FACTORY_STATE` or `FACTORY_REPO` resolves against the caller's directory: `FACTORY_CWD`, else the working directory.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The suite's own-store cases that are not about the uncommitted-edit refusal run the CLI through a test-only launcher that stubs that one check. The refusal itself keeps its tests on a clone's real `bin/factory`. Rejected: a switch the production CLI honours, which would loosen the check. Also rejected: running every case from a committed snapshot of the working tree, which changes every assertion that names this checkout's revision or paths.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The suite scenario gives pytest a fresh temporary directory under `/tmp` and removes it afterwards. Four existing tests need a temporary directory outside every repository, and an agent's scratch directory lies inside this one. The scenario states this in its command, so no role has to choose between its scratch rule and a valid run. Rejected: fixing those four tests in this ticket, which is beyond H8 and needs its own design (Out-of-scope observations).
2026-10-04 T-0023 The workflow-script fixes are checked by acceptance scenarios that run the scripts under node with a stub clerk. They get no suite test, because the suite does not need node today and adding that would change what the gate needs.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The change is built as four seams (design.md, "Size and seams"). They share one changelog entry, 51.
2026-10-04 T-0024 T-0024: instance B keeps the spec store created 2026-10-04 by run-0196; its tickets close by archive into current truth (operator)
2026-10-04 T-0024 While a role run is in flight on a live store, a human or runner writes it by prefixing that one command with FACTORY_DISPATCH=1; README documents it and the refusal text never names it (operator)
2026-10-04 T-0024 Instance B keeps the spec store that run-0196 created. Its tickets close by archive into current truth, and `decisions.md` keeps reaching the spec writer, critic and planner. The operator decided this in the first answer to this ticket, and it is already recorded in `decisions.md`. This is a standing decision. This ticket touches README, so it also corrects README's stale "never entered it" line, as that answer directs.
2026-10-04 T-0024 While a role run is in flight on a live store, the operator or a runner session writes it by putting `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` in front of that one command. README documents this. The refusal text never names the marker. The operator decided this in the same answer, and it is already recorded in `decisions.md`. This is a standing decision for every runner session, including the Driver session that runs the Nanobot fork's instance (instance A).
2026-10-04 T-0024 A write is refused, marker or not and run in flight or not, when the caller's directory lies under the own store's `runs/` or `worktrees/`. The operator's gate review asked for this rule. Rejected: applying it only while a run is in flight, because a process a role left running in its run directory would then write freely once the store went idle. Rejected: letting the marker lift it, because the rule exists so that a copied or exported marker does not help from there. This is a standing decision: the operator and runner sessions run store writes from outside the store.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The location rule is checked first, then the marker, then the in-flight list.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The in-flight rule acts only on an instance's own store, and only while at least one run is in flight on any ticket of that store. Rejected: refusing every unmarked write at all times, as the requester proposed. The operator would then need the marker on every command and would export it in the shell, and every role run started from that shell would inherit it. The operator's decision on the marker assumes unmarked writes when nothing is in flight.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The in-flight rule checks every ticket's in-flight list, not only the calling ticket's. The tool cannot tell which run, if any, is calling.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The marker is the environment variable `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1`. Both workflow scripts put it in front of every clerk command. Rejected: the requester's exemption for "a human's `--by`". Human commands have no `--by`, and `ticket transition` requires one from everyone.
2026-10-04 T-0024 A write is every command except a fixed read-only list: `ticket show`, `ticket join`, `results show`, `config`, `status parse`, `log tail` and `paths`. Any command given `--accept-harness` is a write, because it rewrites the lock and logs. A new command is fenced until someone adds it to the list. Rejected: the requester's list of ten write commands. It misses writes such as `ticket set`, `ticket park`, `ticket head`, `ticket ready-implementers`, `ticket parent-check`, `run compose` and `spec add`.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The refusal exits 2 and writes nothing. Its text is `role runs may not write the live store (<detail>); use a throwaway FACTORY_STATE`. The detail is `<store>; in flight: <run ids>` for the in-flight rule and `<store>; called from inside its runs/` (or `worktrees/`) for the location rule. The advice is meant for a role. The operator learns the marker from README.
2026-10-04 T-0024 A run left in flight by a dead workflow keeps the in-flight rule up. The operator clears it with a marked `run finish <run> --status-override KILLED`, run from the repository root, and README says so. Rejected: a timeout that drops the fence by itself. A long run that is still working would lose the fence.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The fence guards against accidents, not against a determined agent. It is not a security boundary. A role working from outside the store that copies the marker from the workflow scripts or README still gets through. That is recorded under Risk rather than designed around. Isolating role runs at the operating-system level is issue #37.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The fence is checked before the harness lock, the check that each instance runs only the harness revision it has accepted. A fenced command is refused before it reaches the lock, so a fenced `--accept-harness` rewrites nothing. A marked command still meets the lock and its uncommitted-edit refusal unchanged, so the marker cannot be used to get past the lock. Rejected: checking the fence after the lock, because `--accept-harness` rewrites the lock inside that check, so a fenced acceptance would write before it was refused.
2026-10-04 T-0024 Part B (a preamble line) is cut. The incident came from the test suite, not from a command the role typed, so a preamble line would not have stopped it. The refusal text gives the same advice at the moment it matters.
2026-10-04 T-0024 Part C (the tripwire on the store root) is cut. Role runs legitimately write their own run directory in the store (`output.md`, `scratch/`). Clerk commands for other tickets' runs also write the store during a run. A comparison of the store root therefore cannot tell whose write it saw. The fence refuses the write before it happens.
2026-10-04 T-0022 Removing clearly redundant work (a step, run or check that cannot change any outcome) is pre-approved, provided every refusal the pipeline gives today still fires (operator, 2026-10-04: 'slashing clearly redundant work is always going to be OK, if we trust our process')
2026-10-04 T-0022 Under a sub-ticket's Tests to change, the planner may list tests an earlier sibling of the same parent added, with a harness check that each first appeared in a sibling's merge; pre-existing tests still need the approved spec (operator, #40)
2026-10-04 T-0025 The store lives on its own branch, `factory-store`, checked out as a git worktree at the store's path (B1). This is for the operator to confirm at the spec gate. Rejected: B2, the branch written through git plumbing with no working copy. It needs new harness commands to snapshot, show and restore the store, and `git clean -fdx` in the integration checkout deletes the store (Evidence). Rejected: A, a gate exception (operator, 2026-10-04).
2026-10-04 T-0025 A store path must be one the integration branch has never tracked. Both existing stores move from `.factory/state` to `.factory/store`. Rejected: keeping `.factory/state`, where checking out an older commit overwrote an uncommitted record and checking `main` out again deleted it (Evidence).
2026-10-04 T-0025 The branch is named `factory-store`, and the design doc and build spec drop the name `tickets` for it. Rejected: `tickets`, a generic name in a target repo whose branches serve other work, such as the Nanobot repo, which shares its objects with another checkout.
2026-10-04 T-0025 `init` creates a new store as a worktree on an unborn `factory-store` branch, and the operator makes the first commit. On a clone where the branch already exists, `init` checks it out, which restores the store. Rejected: `init` committing, which needs a git identity, and the suite runs under a throwaway HOME that has none.
2026-10-04 T-0025 When no local `factory-store` exists and more than one remote carries it, `init` refuses and names each `<remote>/factory-store`. The operator picks one with `git branch factory-store <remote>/factory-store` and runs `init` again. Rejected: creating a new empty branch, which would silently start a second store history beside the pushed one. Also rejected: preferring `origin`, a guess about which remote is canonical.
2026-10-04 T-0025 With `FACTORY_INSTANCE` unset, `init` refuses, writing nothing, when the caller's git top level is a checkout of `factory-store`. It also refuses when the instance found by walking up from the caller's directory has a store that is that top level, or that contains it in the same repository (the same git common directory). These are the cases where it would build a phantom instance inside the live store. The second condition does not depend on which branch or commit the store has checked out, so a detached store HEAD does not open the route again (operator, round 2 change request N2). The same-repository qualifier keeps `init` working in a separate throwaway repository under a run's scratch directory (Evidence). Rejected: "contains" without that qualifier, which would refuse every suite `init` run with pytest's temporary directory inside a store. Rejected: taking the repository from the parent of `--git-common-dir`. That is the main worktree, which for the Nanobot instance is `~/dev/nanobot`, another checkout on another branch, and for the runtime checkout is `~/dev/spec-factory` (Evidence).
2026-10-04 T-0025 In `init`, every refusal and the store-worktree step come before any instance file is written, so a failed worktree step (for example, git's "already used by worktree" when `init` runs in a code checkout of a repo whose store branch is checked out elsewhere) leaves nothing behind.
2026-10-04 T-0025 The integration checkout ignores the store through the repo's git exclude file, which `init` and `store migrate` write. Rejected: a line in the target's tracked `.gitignore`. That would change the target's code to record a fact about one clone.
2026-10-04 T-0025 A new command, `factory store migrate --to PATH`, moves an existing store. It refuses unless the store is idle and committed, and it leaves the integration-branch side uncommitted for the operator to review. Rejected: a hand procedure, untested, run once on each repo by a different session.
2026-10-04 T-0025 `store migrate` deletes the old store directory only after it has checked that every ignored file (run scratch directories, tripwire baselines) was copied byte for byte. If the check fails, it undoes its own worktree and branch and leaves the old store as it was. Rejected: relying on `git status` in the new checkout, which cannot see ignored files.
2026-10-04 T-0025 The store branch starts with one commit whose tree is the store as last committed on the integration branch, and whose message names that commit. Earlier history stays readable with `git log <that commit> -- .factory/state`. Rejected: rewriting history with a subtree split. It would follow only part of the store's past, which began at `intake/state`, and it adds nothing that `main`'s history does not already keep.
2026-10-04 T-0025 An instance whose store is still a plain directory keeps working unchanged. `init` leaves such a store alone and points to `store migrate`. The harness reads and writes the store only through `state_dir`, so it runs with either layout.
2026-10-04 T-0022 A sub-ticket's "Tests to change" may list a test file that an earlier sibling of the same parent added, one line each: `` `<file>[::<test>]` (added by <sibling ID>): <reason> ``. The harness reads only lines of that form inside the "Tests to change" field, and checks the file, not the test function. Rejected: checking test functions. The implementer rule puts new tests in new files, so a file is what a sibling adds, and git records files.
2026-10-04 T-0022 A listed file counts as added by a sibling when it is absent at the parent's `parent_base`, and the first commit since then on the integration branch that added it lies inside one merged sibling's recorded merge (reachable from its `main_after`, not from its `base_before`). Any merged sibling of the parent counts, including those from an earlier plan. The sibling ID on the line is for the reader and is not matched. Rejected: matching the named ID, because the planner's IDs (`ST-1`) differ from the store's (`T-0001.1`) and the operator's rule names no particular sibling.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The check runs in `run start` for every implementer run of a sub-ticket: first dispatch, fix rounds and catch-up runs. Every dispatch passes through that one place. Rejected: checking when the plan is added, when no sibling has merged yet. Rejected: checking at the merge gate, after the implementer has already edited the test. Rejected: checking where a waiting sub-ticket is released, which happens in two places and never for a sub-ticket with no dependencies.
2026-10-04 T-0022 A failed check refuses the run start with exit 2, writes nothing, and gives an error that starts `BLOCKED from harness:` and names the file. The build workflow parks the sub-ticket with that error as the reason, so `resolve --ruling` handles it like an implementer's BLOCKED. That is what the operator's "parks for the operator, as today" describes. Rejected: a new kind of park with its own resolve verb. Rejected: having `run start` park the ticket itself, which would break the rule that a refusal writes nothing.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The preamble's guardrail sentence and the code reviewer's test-integrity check also accept a sibling entry that the harness has checked. Without them, the implementer and reviewer would still treat the edit as forbidden, and the park would remain.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The earlier sibling names the tests a later sibling will break under a new planner field, "Interim tests". The harness does not read it.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The critic's check for an omitted test goes under rubric 1 (Grounded), where the requester asked for it.
2026-10-04 T-0022 The requester's acceptance, a re-plan and re-spec of Nanobot T-0002 that the operator compares side by side, is an Operator step, not an acceptance scenario. Running it needs the Nanobot store and real agents, which a verifier must not touch.
2026-10-04 T-0032 Empty role output (#41, T-0032): labelled EMPTY-OUTPUT with the last message, re-dispatched once automatically, parked on a second; the code reviewer judges the diff and leaves the test suite and gates to the verifier.
2026-10-04 T-0029 Only the code reviewer lists declared protected paths, once for each head it reviews. The implementer and verifier may name them in their output, but not under ESCALATIONS. This is a standing decision: a later prompt change should not give another role a declared-path notice. The operator pre-approved it on 2026-10-04 (`.factory/answers/operator-decisions-2026-10-04.md`), under the standing decision that removing clearly redundant work is allowed when every refusal still fires.
2026-10-04 T-0029 A fix round makes a new head, so it gets its own reviewer notice, as today. Rejected: one notice per sub-ticket. A fix round can change a declared path again, and the operator would not hear about it.
2026-10-04 T-0029 The new rule also keeps one escalation for a declared path: when the change does something to it that the spec does not describe. An undeclared path still escalates as well. Rejected: the retro's wording "the reviewer lists declared paths for the merge gate". No local merge check reads the declaration, so that sentence would teach the roles something false.
2026-10-04 T-0029 The implementer and verifier get the same bullet word for word, as the last bullet under RULES. That way one text is checked in both prompts.
2026-10-04 T-0029 The changelog records the count re-derived from the store log (10 runs, 30 of 205 items). Rejected: the retro's 26 of 139, which its own table contradicts with 38.
2026-10-04 T-0029 Acceptance checks the composed run prompts and the document copies. The request's own check (on the next build, one notice per head, from the reviewer) is kept as an operator step. Rejected: an acceptance item that waits for a real build. The verifier cannot run one, and how a model follows a prompt rule is not something a check on one commit can prove.
2026-10-05 T-0028 Part A overturns the cut in T-0016's spec. The path-scoped gate skip is built as the operator pre-approved it, with no repository's configuration changed. Rejected: cutting it again because it would have skipped almost no past run. The request expects a small saving here and still asks for the mechanism. Part A is a separate part, so the operator can delete it and its scenarios at the gate.
2026-10-05 T-0028 A gate command's `paths` are git pathspecs. A command is skipped when `git diff --name-only <base>...<head> -- <paths>` lists no file. Include entries (`src/`) and exclude entries (`:(exclude)dev/`) both work. Rejected: a glob matcher of our own, a second matching rule that could disagree with git's. Standing: later tickets and instance configs use pathspec semantics.
2026-10-05 T-0028 If this repository's suite is ever scoped, its paths should exclude what it does not read rather than list what it does: `:(exclude)dev/` and `:(exclude)README.md`. Rejected: the requester's inclusion list, which leaves out `.gitignore` and any new top-level file, so it would skip the suite on changes that fail it.
2026-10-05 T-0028 The harness decides the skip when a reviewer or verifier run starts on a sub-ticket. It reads the live instance's configuration and that run's base and head. The verifier is told which commands are skipped, so it does not decide. Rejected: letting the verifier judge relevance, which no record could check.
2026-10-05 T-0028 Each skipped command is recorded twice: in the checker run's `meta.yaml` (`gate_skipped`) and on the `ci` row (`skipped`). Each entry has the command, `status: SKIPPED` and the reason. The row's PASS or FAIL still comes from the verifier's `Gate suite:` line, over the commands that ran.
2026-10-05 T-0028 A malformed gate entry refuses every implementer, reviewer and verifier run start with exit 2, before a run is created. A malformed entry is anything other than a string, or a mapping with a non-empty string `command` and an optional non-empty list of non-empty strings `paths`, with no other key. Rejected: treating a typo such as `path:` as unscoped. The operator would believe a scope is in force that is not.
2026-10-05 T-0028 An empty `paths` list is refused. Rejected: reading it as "covers nothing", which would skip the command on every diff.
2026-10-05 T-0028 The planner is skipped when all of these hold, and otherwise runs as today: the parent has no sub-ticket and no earlier planner run; its latest spec-writer run did not end NEEDS-SPLIT; and its approved spec has no `##` or `###` heading, other than a `### Requirement:` line, that contains the word seam or seams. This sorts all thirteen past parents as they were built (Evidence). Rejected: the requester's "exactly one lettered part", which would have skipped none of the nine. Rejected: NEEDS-SPLIT alone, which would have built T-0025's two parts, about 470 lines, as one sub-ticket. Standing: the planner runs only for a spec that is split, re-planned or already planned once.
2026-10-05 T-0028 To force the planner on a spec that meets every condition, the operator adds a `### Size and seams` heading in a gate edit (`approve-spec --edit`). No new flag.
2026-10-05 T-0028 The whole-spec sub-ticket is `<parent>.1`, at `ready-for-implementer`, with no dependency. Its text names every scenario of the approved spec, one `- <name>` line each. For everything else it points to the spec: every lettered part, the spec's labels, its Tests to change and its Risk list. Because it names every scenario, the parent closes on its VERIFIED run under the existing rule (part C).
2026-10-05 T-0028 The store records the skip three ways: a `plan.skipped` event in the log with its reason, the parent's plan file (`plans/<parent>.md`), and the change folder's `tasks.md` when the repository has a spec store. A planner-made plan writes the same two files.
2026-10-05 T-0028 A spec already applied on `main`, the planner's most frequent ESCALATE, is caught after the skip by the implementer's step 2 and by the verifier's base run of NEW checks (design part B, table). The catch costs an implementer run in place of a planner run. Rejected: a harness check of "already applied", which would need the agents' judgment of what the spec asks for.
2026-10-07 T-0032 Retry-once-then-park on a role's unusable output (#41's EMPTY-OUTPUT) is the general mechanism: later refusal kinds (#68 format, #67 spec-lint) register with it rather than adding their own. resolve --ruling should also accept a budget-kill or EMPTY-OUTPUT park (rulings had to be placed by hand on T-0029.1 and T-0028.1).
2026-10-07 T-0032 An empty output is `EMPTY-OUTPUT`, never a budget kill. That covers a missing or empty output file, an agent call that returns blank text, and one that returns `null` (a user skip or a terminal API error). Rejected: keeping a budget-kill path for some of these. The harness enforces no budget, and the agent call reports no reason (Evidence).
2026-10-07 T-0032 Standing, from the operator's answer, already in `decisions.md` as the 2026-10-04 T-0032 line, for both parts: the empty-output route, and the reviewer leaving the suite and the gate to the verifier. Later changes follow both.
2026-10-07 T-0032 `EMPTY-OUTPUT` is decided in one place, `run finish`. The workflows no longer send `--status-override KILLED` for an empty return, so `run finish` reads the output file for every run. Rejected: a second override value in the scripts. It would label a run empty even when its output file was written.
2026-10-07 T-0032 The retry is counted inside one workflow run: one re-dispatch, then a park. Rejected: a counter in the store. It would add a ticket field for a case that a human already watches, because a workflow that stops is restarted by hand.
2026-10-07 T-0032 A thrown agent call is not re-dispatched. It carries its own error text, including the error thrown when the turn's token ceiling is spent, so it is the one stop the harness can name.
2026-10-07 T-0032 The last message is kept by a new command, `factory run last-message RUN --text=…`, called only after `run finish` has returned `EMPTY-OUTPUT`. The text is the last 4000 characters, as one shell single-quoted word. Rejected: passing it on every `run finish`, which would put each role's whole output through every clerk command.
2026-10-07 T-0032 A second empty output parks as `EMPTY-OUTPUT from <role>`, in the same form as the other role parks, and lists both runs. The last messages stay in the run directories, not in the reason.
2026-10-07 T-0032 A checker's second empty output parks before any result row is recorded for it. `resolve --redispatch` then re-runs only that checker, because the other checker's passing rows stand. Rejected: an `EMPTY-OUTPUT` result row and a join rule for it, a new row status for the same outcome.
2026-10-07 T-0032 The reviewer's input no longer lists the gate commands. It says that the verifier runs them, as the design's routing table already declares (`docs/design.md:126`).
2026-10-07 T-0032 The `budget kill` join reason is kept for hand-recorded `KILLED` rows. Rejected: renaming it, which would change three existing tests for a case no one reported.
2026-10-07 T-0032 `build.js:137` (the implementer's `budget kill` park) is removed. `run finish` can no longer return `KILLED` to the workflow, so the line would never run.
2026-10-07 T-0033 Protected paths at merge (#57, T-0033): the pinned spec's Risk list is the authorization; an undeclared changed protected path is refused at merge and parks for a ruling; no per-head approval step. All instances.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The critic keeps its minimum check, at least 2 cited paths and 1 acceptance command per review. It gains a cap of at most 2 paths and 1 command for any one claim. Rejected: replacing the minimum with the cap, which would let a critic approve having checked nothing. `docs/principles.md`'s Spiking section states the bound per claim ("Grounding a claim … two paths, one command").
2026-10-08 T-0034 The critic runs no test suite and builds nothing (no clone, worktree or prototype of the change). It runs an acceptance command only as the spec gives it, and picks one that runs no test suite. Standing: a later change to the critic prompt keeps this rule, as principle 2 requires.
2026-10-08 T-0034 A claim the critic could settle only by running a test suite or building the change is a finding for the writer, or a question, and the critic says what it could not check. The finding's severity follows the existing rubric. Rubric item 2 ("NEW items fail today") stays unchanged.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The writer and the critic get the same three reading sentences: batch independent reads and commands, read a line range once grep has found it, and send long output to a scratch file and grep or tail it. Only the writer gets "write the spec in as few writes as you can". The critic writes one verdict and needs no such rule.
2026-10-08 T-0034 No shared preamble line. The rules go only in the two role prompts. Rejected: a preamble line, which would reach every role, including the implementer and verifier, which the request does not cover.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The rules are added as new lines only, so no existing line of either prompt changes. The writer's rule is the last RULES bullet of the documented copy. The critic's rules follow its existing PROCESS line.
2026-10-08 T-0034 `docs/principles.md` records the critic's new rule under principle 2 and corrects principle 2's status line, which says "reader roles run no suites" was done by #41 alone.
2026-10-08 T-0034 The request's acceptance, a replay of 2–3 approved intakes with old and new prompts, is an Operator step. Running it needs live model runs, and judging spec quality side by side is a human call. The scenarios check the text the roles receive.
2026-10-08 T-0035 This change overturns part of a standing decision, one that later tickets must keep, recorded on 2026-10-08 for T-0034, the ticket that applied #73: "The critic runs no test suite and builds nothing ... Standing: a later change to the critic prompt keeps this rule". The no-test-suite half stands. The no-build half and the per-claim cap (T-0034's other 2026-10-08 decision) are removed. Authority: the operator's choice in `.factory/answers/T-0034-acceptance-2026-10-08.md`. Standing: later changes to the critic prompt keep the no-suite rule and do not re-add a per-claim cap or a no-build rule without new evidence.
2026-10-08 T-0035 The critic prompt gains one sentence that allows a small experiment in its scratch directory to confirm a finding. Without it, the kept sentence "A claim you could settle only by ... building the change is a finding" reads as the old ban. The kept sentence still covers building or trying out the change itself, which the request's item C (its `docs/principles.md` change) leaves to the writer or to a spike, a ticket built only to test whether an approach works. Rejected: deleting the kept sentence. The triage role, which sorts a request before the spec writer sees it, asked to keep it, and it still tells the critic what to do with a claim it cannot check.
2026-10-08 T-0035 The no-suite line gains its reason, "the implementer and the verifier run it", as the request's item B (its list of what the critic keeps) gives. `Pick an acceptance command that runs no test suite, and run it as the spec gives it.` and the Turn economy paragraph stay word for word.
2026-10-08 T-0035 The Spiking section records the replay result, as the request's item C asks ("Record the replay result"). The changelog entry records it too.
2026-10-08 T-0035 Of the current-truth requirements that #73 added, four are restated (MODIFIED), because each states the rule being removed or forbids removing a critic line. Other current-truth requirements that check the diff of their own change (for example "The documents record the live-store guard", which expects no prompt copy to change) are left as they are, as #73 left them. Their scenarios describe their own change, not standing behaviour.
2026-10-08 T-0035 "Writer unchanged from #73" is checked as no difference from `05cf8f9` in either writer prompt file, plus the writer's design block equal to its `docs/prompts/` copy. Together these mean the design block is unchanged too.
2026-10-09 T-0036 Triage names the capabilities on a new output line, `Capabilities:`, chosen from a capability index added to its input. A token that names no current-truth capability, such as `none` or `new`, is ignored.
2026-10-09 T-0036 Which capabilities a role receives in full: the names on triage's line, plus each existing capability whose `specs/<name>/spec.md` path appears in the spec the role works from. For the writer that is its previous version on a revision round. For the critic it is the version under review. For the planner it is the approved version, read whole, Evidence included. A writer that opens a capability and cites its path under Evidence therefore hands it to the critic. This keeps the request's rule that the critic sees the writer's list plus whatever the writer opened.
2026-10-09 T-0036 A ticket whose latest finished triage output has no `Capabilities:` line gets today's inputs, the whole of current truth and the whole log. This covers tickets triaged before this change, T-0036 among them. Rejected: sending only the index in that case, which would cut those tickets' inputs with no list to cut by.
2026-10-09 T-0036 An index line for a capability gives its name, its size, the absolute path of its spec and its requirement names. Rejected: the request's "one-sentence purpose", because no capability spec on either store has a purpose paragraph (Evidence).
2026-10-09 T-0036 A decision line goes in full when it is logged against this ticket, or when its text names a capability sent in full as a whole word. The log's other lines are indexed one line per ticket: ticket id, number of decisions, first and last date, and the ticket's title. The index heading gives the command `grep ' <ticket id> ' <absolute path of decisions.md>`. Rejected: one index line per decision, which comes to tens of kilobytes on Nanobot (240 lines, median 278 bytes).
2026-10-09 T-0036 A role opens deferred items by path, with its own file reads or `grep`. No `factory spec show` or `factory decision show` command is added. Rejected: those commands, because a command run from inside a role must clear the live-store fence and find the instance from the role's working directory. A path needs neither, and it is how compose already points at full specs (Evidence).
2026-10-09 T-0036 The instructions live in the index headings. They say the list is complete, that anything in it is opened by its path, and that citing a path hands the capability to the critic. Rejected: editing the writer and critic prompts, which would put the same words in two more protected copies.
2026-10-09 T-0036 A run's `input_sources` lists only the files sent in full. An index adds no source.
2026-10-09 T-0036 The standing 2026-10-04 T-0024 decision says that `decisions.md` "keeps reaching the spec writer, critic and planner". It still does: in full for the lines this ticket touches, and line by line for the rest through the index and its `grep` command.
2026-10-09 T-0036 Acceptance does not hold this change to the request's 40 kB mean and 100 kB maximum. The projection gives a mean of 101 kB and a maximum of 167 kB for the Nanobot store's last ten tickets, and the remainder lies outside this change (Problem, Evidence). The operator steps measure the real figures after the change runs.
2026-10-09 T-0036 The docs use one name for the new index, "capability index".
2026-10-09 T-0037 Decision log in role inputs (#78, T-0037): the spec writer, critic and planner get decisions.md whole; #75's decision filter is removed; any future scoping must not be able to drop a cross-cutting standing decision (see #54).
2026-10-09 T-0037 The spec writer, critic and planner receive `decisions.md` whole whenever it holds any text, whatever capabilities their ticket names. The decision index and its `grep` instruction are removed. This is the operator's Answer 1, already standing in `decisions.md` as the 2026-10-09 T-0037 line. Rejected: the request's rule of sending lines that name no capability in full and filtering the rest. On today's logs it sends every line anyway, and it could still hide a cross-cutting decision that happens to name a capability.
2026-10-09 T-0037 The capability index note loses its clause ", and the decisions that name it to the critic and the planner,"; the rest of the note stays word for word. Rejected: keeping the clause, which would tell the writer that citing a path is how decisions reach the critic and planner. That is no longer so. This edits one sentence of #75's capability half, which the triage assumption kept byte for byte.
2026-10-09 T-0037 The planner's decision part no longer reads triage's capability names or the approved spec's citations. It reads the whole log, as before #75.
2026-10-09 T-0037 The decision part is measured in this spec's Evidence, before and after, on both stores. No new file or harness command records it.
2026-10-09 T-0038 Each sub-ticket records `planned_from`, the parent's approved version when the sub-ticket was created. Nothing changes it afterwards. Rejected: reading `spec.approved_version`, which approved T-0027 moves forward on amendment.
2026-10-09 T-0038 Superseded is computed whenever sub-tickets are read, not stored. A sub-ticket is superseded when it has not merged and its `planned_from` is lower than the highest `planned_from` among its parent's sub-tickets. Rejected: the request's mark written at re-plan time. That needs a write on every path that adds a plan and a migration for stores that already hold such sub-tickets, such as Nanobot T-0024. Also rejected: comparing with the parent's current approved version. That would supersede the live plan after a T-0027 amendment that keeps it.
2026-10-09 T-0038 A record without `planned_from`, or with it null, falls back to its `spec.approved_version`. With neither, the sub-ticket counts as current.
2026-10-09 T-0038 A plan made from the same approved version supersedes nothing. This covers `resolve --replan` after a failed final check, and a second plan added by hand. The design ties a new plan to an amended spec (`docs/design.md:109`). To replace a plan without changing intent, the operator approves with `approve-spec --edit`, which always makes a new version. This is a standing decision.
2026-10-09 T-0038 Merged sub-tickets are never superseded. They count toward the close, the final check must contain their merges, and a new plan may depend on them.
2026-10-09 T-0038 `subticket add` refuses, writing nothing, a plan whose `Depends on:` names a sub-ticket that the plan supersedes. Rejected: accepting it. The dependant would wait forever, because a superseded sub-ticket is never dispatched.
2026-10-09 T-0038 `subticket add` reports the sub-ticket ids it newly supersedes under `superseded` and logs a `subtickets.superseded` event. Nothing is deleted, and every id stays taken.
2026-10-09 T-0038 `ticket ready-implementers` keeps `subtickets` as every sub-ticket id. `build.js` reads an empty list as "planned with none", and `dev/build-harness.spec.md:286` documents it that way. Every other list there leaves superseded sub-tickets out, and the new `superseded` list names them.
2026-10-09 T-0038 The planner is told which sub-tickets its plan will supersede, on one line after the existing list. With none, its input is byte-identical to today.
2026-10-09 T-0038 The name is "superseded", as the request and triage use it, and in the same sense as `results/<head>/superseded-<n>/`: a record kept but no longer counted.
2026-10-09 T-0033 The authorization is the pinned spec's Risk section. The pinned spec is the version the operator approved at the spec gate. For a sub-ticket, that is its parent's approved version (`specs/<parent>/v<approved_version>.md`). A ticket with no parent uses its own approved version. A ticket with no approved spec declares nothing. This is standing for every instance, from the operator's 2026-10-05 answer. It is already the 2026-10-07 T-0033 line in `decisions.md`, the factory's log of standing decisions that later tickets must follow.
2026-10-09 T-0033 The gate reads declarations from one fixed line in the Risk section: `Protected paths: none`, or `Protected paths: ` followed by one or more backticked paths or globs, separated by commas. An optional list marker (`- ` or `* `) may come before it, and an optional full stop after it. Each entry is one path or one glob. A brace list such as `factory/prompts/{a,b}.md` is one literal entry, which git does not expand, so it matches no file and declares nothing. A Risk line in any other shape declares nothing, and so does a line inside a fenced code block. Several such lines declare their union. Standing: specs declare protected paths only this way. Rejected: reading every backticked path in Risk, because today's Risk sections also put the paths they promise not to touch in backticks (Evidence). Rejected: the planner's per-sub-ticket `Protected paths:` field, which an agent writes and no human approves.
2026-10-09 T-0033 A changed path is "protected" when it matches one of the instance's in-repo `protected_paths` globs. It is "declared" when it matches a declared entry. Both matches use git's glob pathspecs (`:(glob)<pattern>`, so `**` crosses directories and `*` does not). This follows the 2026-10-05 T-0028 decision that the harness never adds a glob matcher of its own. Patterns that start with `~` or `/` are skipped.
2026-10-09 T-0033 The changed paths are those of `git diff --name-only --no-renames <integration branch>...<head>`, measured from the merge base; the head is the commit the gate is judging. Once the head contains the integration branch, that is exactly what the merge adds. `--no-renames` lists both sides of a move (Evidence). Rejected: the triage's "parent base". A catch-up run is an implementer run that merges the integration branch into a sub-ticket's branch that has fallen behind. After one, a diff from the parent's base counts other tickets' merged changes against this sub-ticket.
2026-10-09 T-0033 The gate runs this check after the three recorded results and before the containment check and the merge lock. A change that will be refused costs no catch-up run.
2026-10-09 T-0033 A refusal exits 2 and changes no ticket field. It logs one `merge.refused` event with the paths. Its error starts `BLOCKED from merge gate: ` and names each undeclared path, sorted and comma-separated. It names no declared path and uses no backtick, `$` or double quote, because the build workflow passes the reason through a shell command.
2026-10-09 T-0033 The build workflow parks the sub-ticket with that error, verbatim, as the reason. It already does the same for the harness's `BLOCKED from harness:` refusal at run start.
2026-10-09 T-0033 The human answers that park with one of two commands. `resolve --ruling F` sends the change back. It uses the existing BLOCKED route: the sub-ticket returns to its implementer with F in its input, and its round count (the number of fix cycles it may use) is not reset. The new `resolve --accept-paths F` accepts the paths under the approved design. It records F as the sub-ticket's next ruling. It adds the undeclared paths, recomputed on the current head, to a ticket field `accepted_paths`, which the gate treats as declared. It returns the sub-ticket to `checks-in-flight`, the state in which the reviewer and verifier judge it, with its recorded results kept, so the build merges it on its next pass. Rejected: one acceptance per head, because a catch-up run makes a new head and the same paths would park again. Rejected: amending the pinned spec's Risk section, because no command amends a pinned spec yet (T-0027 asks for one). An acceptance adds paths only for that sub-ticket and leaves every other merge condition in force.
2026-10-09 T-0033 `--accept-paths` refuses, with exit 2 and nothing written, on a park whose reason does not start `BLOCKED from merge gate:`. Its error starts `--accept-paths applies to`. It also refuses when the head is not the branch tip, or when no undeclared protected path remains.
2026-10-09 T-0033 A ruling on a park whose reason starts `ESCALATE from reviewer` returns the sub-ticket to `checks-in-flight`, round count unchanged. Its recorded results are set aside as `--redispatch` sets them aside: an APPROVE reviewer result is kept, and a VERIFIED verifier result with a PASS gate result is kept. Every other result moves to `superseded-<n>/`. The reviewer and verifier runs that follow receive the ruling, as they already do (`factory/compose.py` lines 278 and 300). This overturns `docs/design.md` line 109, which sends a reviewer ESCALATE to the implementer with the round count reset. Rejected: that route, because the 2026-10-05 escalation needed no code change. The re-run reviewer can still return REQUEST-CHANGES when a ruling asks for a fix.
2026-10-09 T-0033 Check 6 of the reviewer prompt keeps its first two sentences and adds "for the record" to the list of declared paths. Its last sentence says what the gate does: it merges a declared path with no further approval, and refuses and parks one the approved spec does not declare.
2026-10-09 T-0033 No per-head approval is added for paths that change the factory's own rules (option 3 of the operator's answer). The answer leaves it open for this spec gate. Adding it is a gate edit to this spec (a new lettered part) or a later ticket.
2026-10-09 T-0030 T-0030 (#24 A+C) closed as partly applied: part C merged (T-0030.3); parts A, B and per-role effort moved to #65 (backlog review 2026-10-09). Current truth was not folded for this ticket.
2026-10-09 T-0026 T-0026 (#47) withdrawn: merged into #65 at the backlog review 2026-10-09; the Workflow scripts it would change retire with #65.

## Your prior findings (round 1)

Round 1 review of T-0039 v1 (reading rules for the implementer, verifier, code reviewer, planner and triage).

What I checked myself (repo at `b002c95`, commands run through the fresh-HOME wrapper):
- Cited paths and lines: `factory/prompts/critic.md` 50-55 and `docs/design.md` 485-490 hold the critic paragraph as quoted; `factory/prompts/spec_writer.md` 59-65 holds the writer form with the "suite run" example and the one-write sentence; `factory/prompts/reviewer.md` 7-8 is the "Do not run the test suite or the gate commands" rule; `factory/compose.py` 186-188 writes the "Scratch directory" section; `docs/changelog.md` line 63 is entry 59 (#74) and carries the 37% figure; `tests/factory/test_capability_index.py` 249-259 limits its 72-column check to lines containing "capabilit"; `docs/principles.md` 173 credits reading rules to #73 only. `grep -rli 'turn economy'` over the three prompt locations matches only the writer and critic copies.
- Placement anchors: the declared-path bullet is the last RULES bullet in `factory/prompts/implementer.md` (line 44, PR DESCRIPTION at 51) and `verifier.md` (line 34, OUTPUT at 41); `reviewer.md` line 10 ends WHAT YOU RUN; `planner.md` line 19 ends RULES; `triage.md` line 28 is the CLARIFY line, and `diff docs/prompts/01-triage.md factory/prompts/triage.md` shows only the instance-added block at 30-33.
- Tests that read the five prompts (`test_coding_standard.py` 82, `test_writing_standard.py` 74, `test_decision_log.py` 248, `test_capability_index.py` 249-259) compare a design block to its `docs/prompts/` copy or check specific triage lines; none pins a bullet count, a line number or the full text. "Tests to change: none" holds.
- Acceptance run as written on base: scenario "The five role prompts carry the critic's reading paragraph in every copy" printed the five lines with `copy=SAME doc=0 run=0 writes=0 fill=unchanged`; the changelog scenario printed `63 CONTIGUOUS` then `terms=2 footer=1`. Both match the Acceptance section's stated base output. Saved under the run's scratch directory.
- Request vs spec: the request's "changelog 58" is a mis-cite; the spec's correction to entry 59 is right. The critic-form choice, the preamble rejection and the Operator-step placement of the replay are each stated with a reason. Protected paths line names all ten prompt copies in the gate's fixed form. No open ticket (T-0027, T-0031) touches these prompts.

Findings

[BLOCKING] 6 Problem, first paragraph
Problem: The first paragraph glosses what a role is and says nothing about what is wrong or for whom; the reader learns the defect only in paragraph 3.
Evidence: Paragraph 1 is "The factory runs each step of a ticket as a separate model agent, a 'role': ... Each role is steered by its own written prompt." The writing standard's rule 1 check is "a reader who stops after the first paragraph can say what the problem is and who has it"; that reader cannot. The rubric makes this BLOCKING by name.
Suggested fix: Open with one sentence such as "Five of the factory's seven role prompts (implementer, verifier, code reviewer, planner, triage) lack the reading rules that cut the spec writer's tokens by about 37%, and the two that run test suites pay the most for it", then keep the role gloss as the rest of that paragraph.

[SHOULD-FIX] 1, 6 Problem paragraph 2; Evidence bullet 3; Risk
Problem: The spec quotes only the favourable half of changelog entry 59; the same entry records that #73's critic rules saved nothing (0.71M to 0.72M, 1.0M to 0.93M, 1.67M to 1.63M tokens) and made the critic check less, which is the risk the Risk section describes and the operator's reason to run the replay.
Evidence: `docs/changelog.md` line 63: "...cut its tokens by about 37% at the same quality, but that its critic rules saved nothing ... and made the critic check less: it missed the Nanobot `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR` risk". The spec's Evidence bullet 3 quotes the entry up to "at the same quality". T-0035 later attributed the under-checking to the critic's cap and build ban, not to the three reading sentences, which it kept.
Suggested fix: Add one sentence to Evidence (and a clause to Risk) stating entry 59's critic result and that T-0035 kept the reading sentences while removing the cap and build ban, so the operator sees the one measured case where these rules did not pay.

Not findings, noted for the implementer: scenario "Triage and planner runs receive the reading paragraph" reuses the `FACTORY_STATE` throwaway-store pattern of current-truth scenario "Planner, spec writer and critic runs get the new rules in their system prompts", so I did not re-run it; scenario "Implementer, reviewer and verifier runs receive the reading paragraph" needs the role-escalations GIVEN fixture run first, as the spec says.

I could not check: that the harness suite passes on the prototype (the verifier runs it); the spec's report of 4 location-dependent failures in `tests/factory/test_instance.py` on both base and prototype is plausible but unverified by me.

STATUS: REVISE
CONFIDENCE: high, every cited path, line and base output I checked matched the spec, and the one blocking item is a one-sentence reorder.

 ## Problem
 
-The factory runs each step of a ticket as a separate model agent, a "role": triage sorts a request, the spec writer drafts a spec, the critic checks it, the planner splits it into sub-tickets, the implementer writes the code, the code reviewer reads the diff and the verifier re-runs the checks. Each role is steered by its own written prompt.
+Five of the factory's seven role prompts lack the reading rules that cut the spec writer's token use by about 37% at the same quality. The five are triage, planner, implementer, code reviewer and verifier. The operator pays for those tokens on every ticket. The implementer and the verifier pay the most, because they run test suites and other long commands.

Each role is steered by its own written prompt.
 
-An agent works in turns. A turn is one call to the model, and every call re-sends everything the agent has read so far in the run. A file read whole, or a test run printed in full, is paid for again on every later turn. Issue #73 gave the spec writer and the critic a short paragraph of reading rules: put independent reads and commands in one turn, read only the line range a search found, and send long command output to a file in the run's scratch directory (a per-run folder for temporary files), then search or tail that file. In the operator's replay of past runs, the spec writer's tokens fell by about 37% with the same spec quality.

All three copies change. The operator's replay of past build runs then decides whether the running harness moves to the new prompts.

+- The 37% result is changelog entry 59 (`docs/changelog.md` line 63, the #74 entry: "found that #73's spec writer rules cut its tokens by about 37% at the same quality"). The same entry records the other half: #73's critic rules "saved nothing (0.71M to 0.72M, 1.0M to 0.93M, 1.67M to 1.63M tokens) and made the critic check less". It missed one Nanobot risk and one declaration bug that the earlier prompt had caught. #73 had given the critic more than the reading paragraph: a cap of two paths and one command per claim, and a ban on clones, worktrees and prototypes. Entry 59 (#74, T-0035) removed the cap and the ban and kept "the three reading rules". So the one measured case where #73's rules did not pay came bundled with the cap, and the reading rules have a measured saving only on the spec writer. The request cites entry 58, which records the #73 change itself and the 309M of 866M spec-writer token share. I could not find a source in this repo for the request's 18% (implementer) and 13% (verifier) token shares. They motivate the change but no criterion depends on them.
 - The three copies agree today: for triage, planner, implementer, code reviewer and verifier, each design block is byte-identical to its `docs/prompts/` file. The run copies differ from the documented ones only by harness fills: `{gate commands}` and `{force-push allowed}` in the implementer, `{gate commands}` in the verifier, `{2}` in the reviewer, and an instance-added "Acceptance items describe behaviour" block at the end of triage's RULES.
 - Every role run, the five included, receives a "Scratch directory" section in its input (`factory/compose.py` lines 186-188), so "your scratch directory" means something to each of them.
 - The code reviewer is told "Do not run the test suite or the gate commands" (`factory/prompts/reviewer.md` lines 7-8). The spec writer's example "such as a suite run" would sit badly next to that rule.

 ## Risk
 
-Every future run of the five roles reads this paragraph once the runtime moves. The behavioural risk is a role that reads too little. For example, a verifier might tail a suite log and miss a failure printed earlier. The paragraph does not lift the verifier's "Record the actual output" or the implementer's acceptance-result reporting. A role that greps a log still reports what it found. The operator's replay is the check on this risk. A merge into `main` does not change the running harness, so nothing reaches live runs until the operator moves the runtime.

There is a precedent: the #74 replay (changelog entry 59) found that #73's critic rules saved no tokens and made the critic check less. #74 acted on it by removing the cap and the build ban and keeping the reading sentences, but the two were never tested apart. The operator's replay is the check on this risk. A merge into `main` does not change the running harness, so nothing reaches live runs until the operator moves the runtime.

+- [BLOCKING] 6, Problem first paragraph → FIXED. The Problem now opens with what is wrong and for whom: five of the seven role prompts (triage, planner, implementer, code reviewer, verifier) lack the reading rules that cut the spec writer's tokens by about 37% at the same quality; the operator pays for those tokens on every ticket, and the implementer and verifier pay most because they run suites and long commands. The role gloss follows in the same paragraph. The request's 18% and 13% shares are still left out of the Problem, because I found no source for them in this repo (Evidence bullet 3).
+- [SHOULD-FIX] 1, 6, Problem paragraph 2, Evidence bullet 3, Risk → FIXED. Evidence bullet 3 now quotes the other half of changelog entry 59 (`docs/changelog.md` line 63): #73's critic rules "saved nothing (0.71M to 0.72M, 1.0M to 0.93M, 1.67M to 1.63M tokens) and made the critic check less". It also says #73 gave the critic a per-claim cap and a build ban besides the reading paragraph, and that #74 removed the cap and ban and kept "the three reading rules". Problem paragraph 2 says the replay found no critic saving and that the cap was removed while the rules stayed. Risk now names this as the precedent and says the reading sentences and the cap were never tested apart, which is one reason for the operator's replay. Re-checked on `b002c95` (unchanged since round 1): the changelog scenario still prints `63 CONTIGUOUS`, then `terms=2 footer=1`, and `git diff --check main...HEAD` prints `exit=0`.
