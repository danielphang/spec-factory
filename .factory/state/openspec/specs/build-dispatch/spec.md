# build-dispatch

## Requirements

### Requirement: A park reason carries the failing command's error
When a store command fails and its relayed stderr is empty, the workflow scripts MUST put the refusal's JSON `error`, or else the exit code, after the reason's prefix, so that no park reason ends blank.

#### Scenario: A refused archive or sub-ticket add parks with the refusal text
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify"}}, "ticket parent-check": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify", "reuse": "run-0001-verifier"}}, "archive": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "no spec store (factory init not run)"}, "exit": 2}}'; node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-planner"}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "PLANNED"}}, "subticket add": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "ST-2: no Depends on line"}, "exit": 2}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `park: archive: no spec store (factory init not run)`, then `start: planner`, then `park: harness-bug: subticket add: ST-2: no Depends on line`

#### Scenario: A refused run start during intake parks with the refusal text
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/intake.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-triage", "round": {"spec": 0}}}, "run start": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "T-0001 is parked, not ready-for-triage"}, "exit": 2}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: triage`, then `park: harness-bug: run start triage: T-0001 is parked, not ready-for-triage`

#### Scenario: A command that prints no JSON parks with its exit code
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify"}}, "ticket parent-check": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify", "reuse": "run-0001-verifier"}}, "archive": {"raw": "", "exit": 1}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `park: archive: exit 1, no JSON on stdout`

### Requirement: The build runs only the checkers a commit still needs
When a sub-ticket reaches the checks without an implementer run in that pass, the build MUST run only the checkers that have no result row on its commit; after an implementer run it SHALL run both.

#### Scenario: A redispatched sub-ticket runs only the checker whose row was set aside
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show T-0001 ": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "planned"}}, "ticket ready-implementers": [{"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": ["T-0001.1"], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}, {"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}], "ticket show T-0001.1": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "checks-in-flight"}}, "ticket head": {"out": {"ok": true, "head": "abababababababababababababababababababab"}}, "results show": {"out": {"ok": true, "rows": {"verifier": "VERIFIED", "ci": "PASS"}, "missing": ["reviewer"]}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "APPROVE"}}, "ticket join": {"out": {"ok": true, "decision": "park", "reason": "stub stop"}}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: reviewer`, then `park: stub stop`

#### Scenario: After an implementer run both checkers run
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show T-0001 ": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "planned"}}, "ticket ready-implementers": [{"out": {"ok": true, "ready": ["T-0001.1"], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}, {"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}], "ticket show T-0001.1": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-implementer"}}, "ticket head": {"out": {"ok": true, "head": "abababababababababababababababababababab"}}, "results show": {"out": {"ok": true, "rows": {"reviewer": "REQUEST-CHANGES", "verifier": "VERIFIED", "ci": "PASS"}, "missing": []}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "READY-FOR-REVIEW"}}, "ticket join": {"out": {"ok": true, "decision": "park", "reason": "stub stop"}}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: implementer`, `start: reviewer`, `start: verifier`, `park: stub stop`, one per line

### Requirement: The workflows' clerk commands carry the dispatcher marker
Every store command that `factory/workflows/intake.js` and `factory/workflows/build.js` send to the clerk MUST carry `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` in its environment assignments, so that a dispatch SHALL still complete on a live store while its own role run is in flight.

#### Scenario: Every clerk command of both workflows carries the marker
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once.
- WHEN `(echo "intake: $(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-count.mjs factory/workflows/intake.js)"; echo "build: $(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-count.mjs factory/workflows/build.js)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `intake: sent unmarked=0`, then `build: sent unmarked=0`

#### Scenario: An intake run against a real store reaches its end with its run in flight
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once. The clerk commands run for real on a scratch instance's own store, from the checkout under test, and the triage run is in flight when the workflow records its result.
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && (cd $T/tgt && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md && $B ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null) && echo "returned=$(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-e2e.mjs $T/tgt/.factory) stored=$(cd $T/tgt && $B ticket show T-0001 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `returned=closed stored=closed`
