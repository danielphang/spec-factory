## Context for this run (composed by the harness, not part of the request)

Repository: `spec-factory`, the design repo at `~/dev/spec-factory` (branch `main`). It holds the
design and the harness that runs it:
- `docs/design.md`, the design document and the source of truth, with its changelog in
  `docs/changelog.md`;
- `docs/prompts/`, each file a verbatim copy of one prompt block in the design doc; it changes only
  by re-copying that block;
- `dev/`, the working documents for building the factory itself: `dev/build-harness.spec.md` (the
  spec for building the harness), `dev/build-harness.plan.md` (the Planner's decomposition of it),
  `dev/P0-intake-skeleton.md` (the walking skeleton) and `dev/issues.md` (this repo's issue index);
- the harness, as code in this repo: `factory/` (the package, its role prompts and its workflow
  scripts), `bin/factory` (the entry point), `agents/` (the agent definition templates) and
  `tests/factory/` (its suite). Install with `uv sync --frozen`; test with
  `uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory`;
- `.factory/`, this repo's own instance of the factory: `instance.yaml`, this briefing,
  `harness.lock`, closed records (`answers/`, `green-pilot/`) and the live store, `state/`.
  The store is tracked on `main` and the operator commits it between steps, so `main` moves even
  when no ticket merges.

Two checkouts. Tickets are built and merged in the dev checkout, `~/dev/spec-factory` on `main`.
The factory runs from the runtime checkout, `~/dev/spec-factory-harness`, a detached worktree of
this repo at the harness revision `.factory/harness.lock` has accepted. A merge into `main` never
changes the running code; only the upgrade step moves the runtime, after which the instance
refuses its store until `--accept-harness`. Your shell may start in another directory: use
absolute paths, or `cd ~/dev/spec-factory && <cmd>`.

The Nanobot fork at `~/dev/nanobot-upstream` (branch `feat/lionbot-v3.5`) is instance A: a target
with only `.factory/`, run from the same runtime by its own Driver session. This repo's harness was
imported from its retired `feat/lionbot-v3` branch. Read it only to observe what a fix does there; never write there, and never copy its test names,
line numbers or commit SHAs into a spec. Never read or write `~/.nanobot/` (live credentials).

Acceptance commands must be runnable as written from `~/dev/spec-factory` (grep, sed, diff,
`git diff --check` against the documents, the harness suite). A change to the design doc keeps its
own conventions: its changelog entry in `docs/changelog.md`, `dev/build-harness.spec.md`
consistent with the new text, and any `docs/prompts/` file whose block changed re-copied from it.

The request is an issue draft, written from a real pipeline run: where in the documents,
what happened (the evidence), why it matters, a proposed fix, and the Nanobot-side commit
where a harness fix already exists. The evidence is the requirement; the proposed fix is the
requester's suggestion, not a requirement. Verify the as-built fix in the reference harness
before relying on it; a NEW criterion that already passes on this checkout proves nothing.

Output: write your complete output, in your role's required format and ending with the
STATUS / CONFIDENCE / ESCALATIONS trailer, to the file named under "Output file" below. For
every role but the implementer that is the only file you may create or modify. The implementer
also changes files in its own worktree and commits there, and nowhere else. Then return the same
text as your final message.

This repo's current-state page is the top-level `README.md`. A change to a command, state, stop or
path updates it in the same ticket; read its "Maintaining this page" section before editing it.

Who reads what the roles write here: the operator at the spec gate, and a technical reader new to this project reading the README or a PR description. Gloss every term specific to the factory at first use (docs/writing.md).
## Output file
`/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/state/runs/run-0249-spec_writer/output.md`

## Running code
Run every test, script or prototype through this wrapper, which gives it a fresh temporary HOME so it cannot write the operator's real home directory: `(export HOME="$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P)"; <command>)`. Put your command in place of <command>. This includes every test or check command the briefing above gives. A throwaway HOME does not stop a write to an absolute path: never run anything that could write a protected path outside the repository.

## Scratch directory
Put every file you make for your own use in this run under `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/.factory/state/runs/run-0249-spec_writer/scratch`: no other run uses it. The harness clears it when the ticket moves on, and keeps it while the ticket is parked.

## Ticket (Triage output)

Type: feature

Title: Amend a pinned spec after planning, and a critic check for scenarios that depend on another approved, unmerged ticket

Summary:
Once the operator approves a spec at the spec gate (the one human sign-off on a design before code is written), the harness pins it: it freezes that version and copies its scenarios into the ticket's change folder. From then on, no command can change it. Yet its acceptance scenarios can stop passing when another ticket merges first, even though the code is correct. The requester needs two things, which the operator approved as one ticket:
- A, a human-only `factory spec amend <parent> --file <amended spec> --reason "<line>"` command. It works at any state after pinning and before archive (the step that writes a closed ticket's scenarios into the repo's current-truth specs). It writes a new spec version, re-pins the change folder and records the amendment with a diff summary and a log event. Every later role run then receives the amended version. It refuses while a sub-ticket is in flight. Merged sub-tickets keep their results, and the record notes which scenarios changed after they merged.
- B, a critic rule at the spec gate. The critic is the agent that grades a spec before the operator sees it. For each scenario, it asks whether the scenario depends on behaviour that an approved but unmerged ticket changes. If it does, that is a finding: the finding names the ticket and its decision, and the scenario's setup must hold whichever ticket merges first.

Evidence:
- The request names two incidents, and I read the record of each.
  - Nanobot v3.5, 2026-10-04: SPEC-20 (Nanobot ticket T-0002) merged and made WhatsApp groups fail closed when no policy store exists. Two pinned scenarios of SPEC-05 (Nanobot ticket T-0008) create no store, so they cannot pass. The implementer reported itself blocked in run-0166. The workaround is a ruling: a human's written instruction, filed under the ticket's approvals, that the harness passes to later runs. `~/dev/nanobot-upstream/.factory/state/approvals/T-0008.1/ruling-1.md` and `.../T-0008/ruling-1.md` exist. Each says "Test setup only. No behaviour change, and no change to any THEN" and seeds a `policies.json`. The request expects the same seeding in two more Nanobot specs, SPEC-01 and SPEC-04.
  - spec-factory, 2026-10-03: `.factory/state/approvals/T-0012/amendment-1.md` exists. It records that the operator "Applied in place to `specs/T-0012/v3.md` (the pinned version every checker reads)". That was a hand edit; no command produced it.
- In the dev checkout, only the gate can change a spec. `factory/cli.py:669-672`: `approve-spec` refuses unless the ticket is `awaiting-spec-gate`, and `--edit` writes a new version only past that check.
- A ruling reaches later runs, but archive never sees it. `factory/compose.py:141-222` hands `ruling-*` approval files to role runs as "Human ruling". `factory/specstore.py:336-357` (`archive`) applies the deltas from the pinned change folder, so a ruling's change never reaches current truth.
- No amend command exists yet. `grep -n "amendment" factory/*.py` returns nothing in the dev checkout, and `grep -n amend` in the runtime checkout's `factory/cli.py` and `factory/compose.py` returns nothing. The request cites no reference-harness commit, so I had no as-built fix to check.
- The design doc already allows the human to amend: `docs/design.md:102` says "the human amends the spec and re-plans". Line 104 says "The human may amend the sub-ticket or the pinned spec first; the amended version is what the implementer and checkers receive". No command implements this.
- The operator approved it: `.factory/answers/operator-decisions-2026-10-04.md` says "#44: approve parts A (spec amend, human-only, logged) and B (critic cross-ticket check) as one ticket, pre-approved." It quotes the operator's words, and the harness relayed the same words verbatim for this run.

Assumptions:
- One claim in the request is narrower than it reads. Only a ticket in the `planned` state has no route back to the gate. A parked ticket that has a spec version does have one: `factory resolve <id> --to spec-gate` (`factory/cli.py:758-764`). But that route goes through `approve-spec`, which moves the ticket to `ready-for-planner`. For a parent with merged sub-tickets, that means re-planning from scratch, not amending, so the need still stands. (inference)
- When the amended spec is "handed to every later role run", I take that to mean the runs that read the pinned spec: implementer, reviewer, verifier and the parent-close run. The amendment record should be handed to them the way a ruling is now. (inference)
- In A, "re-pins the change folder" includes `archive` writing the amended scenarios into current truth. That is the stated harm, so the acceptance tests should check it. (inference)
- Part B works across tickets, and #40 part C (tests a decision overturns, now T-0022, which is in triage) works within one ticket. Both change the critic's prompt. The spec writer should check the two critic edits for conflicts. (inference)
- Part A changes harness code (`factory/**`, `bin/factory`). Part B changes the critic prompt in the design doc and its copy under `docs/prompts/`. Both are protected paths, so the spec's Risk section must declare them. (inference)
- Suggested priority (a suggestion; priority is the human's call): after the small fixes already queued. Today's workaround, a ruling, still lets tickets build. Archive is the only step it breaks.

Reason: ACCEPT. There is no duplicate. Issue #44 in `dev/issues.md` is this request and has no ticket yet. T-0022 (#40) covers only the within-one-ticket case. The intent is clear, and the operator has already approved the product call (A and B as one ticket).

Out-of-scope observations:
- The T-0012 amendment note itself proposes a follow-up: `init` could write a store-level `.gitattributes` with `runs/** -whitespace`, so that run records stop failing `git diff --check`. I found no ticket for it.

STATUS: ACCEPT
CONFIDENCE: high. I read every cited record and the harness lines behind each claim, and the operator's approval is on file in the decisions record.
ESCALATIONS: none

## Request (raw)

---
title: "Amend a pinned spec after planning (scenarios broken by another ticket's merge), and a critic check for cross-ticket dependencies"
labels: "harness"
---
**Problem:** once a spec is pinned and its ticket planned, nobody can amend it, even when its scenarios become wrong because another ticket merged first. `approve-spec --edit` works only at `awaiting-spec-gate`, and `planned` has no route back to the gate. The workaround today is a ruling (compose hands rulings to the implementer, the checkers and the parent-close run). But `archive` then writes the unamended scenario text into current truth, where it would fail if re-run.

**Evidence:**
- Nanobot v3.5, 2026-10-04: T-0008 (SPEC-05, typing) was approved while T-0002 (SPEC-20) was unbuilt. T-0002 then merged and made WhatsApp groups fail closed without a policy store. Two of T-0008's pinned scenarios create no store, so they cannot pass, though the code is correct. T-0008.1 BLOCKED (run-0166). The Driver ruled "test setup only: seed a policies.json; THEN lines unchanged" in `approvals/T-0008.1/` and `approvals/T-0008/`. The same seeding is expected in T-0004 (SPEC-01) and T-0007 (SPEC-04).
- spec-factory, 2026-10-03: T-0012's parent close hit a scenario that could not pass as written (whitespace over the store). The Green session amended the pinned `specs/T-0012/v3.md` in place and recorded it in `approvals/T-0012/amendment-1.md`. That was a hand edit, with no command behind it.

**Proposed change:**
- A. `factory spec amend <parent> --file <amended spec> --reason "<line>"`: human-run, at any state after pinning and before archive.
  - It writes a new spec version, re-pins the change folder (the OpenSpec deltas), and records the amendment in `approvals/<parent>/amendment-<n>.md` with a diff summary and a log event.
  - Compose then hands the amended version to every later role run.
  - It refuses when a sub-ticket is in flight. Merged sub-tickets keep their results, and the amendment notes which scenarios changed after they merged.
- B. **The critic's cross-ticket check at the spec gate.** For each scenario, does it depend on behaviour that an approved but unmerged ticket changes? If so, it is a finding: name the ticket and the decision, and require the scenario's setup to hold under both orders. This is the same class as #40 (tests a decision overturns), applied across tickets.

**Gate:** A is a human-only command, but it changes what the spec gate pins. It waits for the operator's approval at the gate. B is a prompt rule (pre-approved class).

Reported by the Nanobot v3.5 Driver.

Operator (2026-10-04): parts A and B approved as one ticket; the spec gate is pre-approved (`.factory/answers/operator-decisions-2026-10-04.md`).

## Current truth: build-dispatch

# build-dispatch

## Requirements

### Requirement: A park reason carries the failing command's error
When a store command fails and its relayed stderr is empty, the workflow scripts MUST put the refusal's JSON `error`, or else the exit code, after the reason's prefix, so that no park reason ends blank.

#### Scenario: A refused archive or sub-ticket add parks with the refusal text
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify"}}, "ticket parent-check": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify", "reuse": "run-0001-verifier"}}, "archive": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "no spec store (factory init not run)"}, "exit": 2}}'; node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-planner"}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "PLANNED"}}, "subticket add": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "ST-2: no Depends on line"}, "exit": 2}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `park: archive: no spec store (factory init not run)`, then `start: planner`, then `park: harness-bug: subticket add: ST-2: no Depends on line`

#### Scenario: A refused run start during intake parks with the refusal text
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/intake.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-triage", "round": {"spec": 0}}}, "run start": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "T-0001 is parked, not ready-for-triage"}, "exit": 2}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: triage`, then `park: harness-bug: run start triage: T-0001 is parked, not ready-for-triage`

#### Scenario: A command that prints no JSON parks with its exit code
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify"}}, "ticket parent-check": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify", "reuse": "run-0001-verifier"}}, "archive": {"raw": "", "exit": 1}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `park: archive: exit 1, no JSON on stdout`

### Requirement: The build runs only the checkers a commit still needs
When a sub-ticket reaches the checks without an implementer run in that pass, the build MUST run only the checkers that have no result row on its commit; after an implementer run it SHALL run both.

#### Scenario: A redispatched sub-ticket runs only the checker whose row was set aside
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show T-0001 ": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "planned"}}, "ticket ready-implementers": [{"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": ["T-0001.1"], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}, {"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}], "ticket show T-0001.1": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "checks-in-flight"}}, "ticket head": {"out": {"ok": true, "head": "abababababababababababababababababababab"}}, "results show": {"out": {"ok": true, "rows": {"verifier": "VERIFIED", "ci": "PASS"}, "missing": ["reviewer"]}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "APPROVE"}}, "ticket join": {"out": {"ok": true, "decision": "park", "reason": "stub stop"}}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: reviewer`, then `park: stub stop`

#### Scenario: After an implementer run both checkers run
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show T-0001 ": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "planned"}}, "ticket ready-implementers": [{"out": {"ok": true, "ready": ["T-0001.1"], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}, {"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}], "ticket show T-0001.1": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-implementer"}}, "ticket head": {"out": {"ok": true, "head": "abababababababababababababababababababab"}}, "results show": {"out": {"ok": true, "rows": {"reviewer": "REQUEST-CHANGES", "verifier": "VERIFIED", "ci": "PASS"}, "missing": []}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "READY-FOR-REVIEW"}}, "ticket join": {"out": {"ok": true, "decision": "park", "reason": "stub stop"}}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: implementer`, `start: reviewer`, `start: verifier`, `park: stub stop`, one per line

### Requirement: The workflows' clerk commands carry the dispatcher marker
Every store command that `factory/workflows/intake.js` and `factory/workflows/build.js` send to the clerk MUST carry `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` in its environment assignments, so that a dispatch SHALL still complete on a live store while its own role run is in flight.

#### Scenario: Every clerk command of both workflows carries the marker
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once.
- WHEN `(echo "intake: $(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-count.mjs factory/workflows/intake.js)"; echo "build: $(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-count.mjs factory/workflows/build.js)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `intake: sent unmarked=0`, then `build: sent unmarked=0`

#### Scenario: An intake run against a real store reaches its end with its run in flight
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once. The clerk commands run for real on a scratch instance's own store, from the checkout under test, and the triage run is in flight when the workflow records its result.
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && (cd $T/tgt && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md && $B ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null) && echo "returned=$(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-e2e.mjs $T/tgt/.factory) stored=$(cd $T/tgt && $B ticket show T-0001 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `returned=closed stored=closed`

## Current truth: harness-docs

## Requirements

### Requirement: The documents record the change
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain entry 51 covering every part, numbered without a gap, `README.md` SHALL describe the new `resolve` behaviour and relative environment paths, and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the change in order
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print n, (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; sed -n '/^51\. /p' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e BLOCKED -e '--replan' -e 'next free' -e 'error text' -e redispatch -e '-whitespace' -e context.md -e relative -e uncommitted | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `51 CONTIGUOUS`, then `9`

#### Scenario: The README describes the new resolve verbs
- WHEN `(echo "replan=$(grep -c -- '--replan' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') gap=$(grep -c 'has no .resolve. verb' README.md)")`
- THEN it prints `replan=1 gap=0`

#### Scenario: The README says relative paths resolve from the caller's directory
- WHEN `(grep -c 'relative .FACTORY_' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')`
- THEN it prints `1`

#### Scenario: The change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the live-store guard
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for this change as its last numbered entry, numbered without a gap; `docs/design.md` SHALL describe the dispatcher marker and the run-directory rule; README's "Where a human decides" SHALL open with the marker's exact command form and say that the refusal deliberately does not name it; README SHALL say the final verifier run is listed as in flight and SHALL no longer say the factory's capabilities never entered the spec store; no prompt copy under `docs/prompts/` or `factory/prompts/` SHALL change; and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the guard as its last entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -oF -e FACTORY_DISPATCH -e 'in flight' -e throwaway -e 'exit 2' -e 'worktrees/' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: The design doc names the marker and the run-directory rule, and no prompt copy changes
- WHEN `(echo "design=$(grep -c FACTORY_DISPATCH docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') dirs=$(grep FACTORY_DISPATCH docs/design.md | grep -c 'worktrees/' | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') prompts=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design=1 dirs=1 prompts=0`

#### Scenario: README tells the operator how to write during a run, first thing under Where a human decides
- WHEN `(H=$(sed -n '/^## Where a human decides/,/^## What is built/p' README.md); J=$(echo "$H" | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "first=$(echo "$H" | sed -n '3p' | grep -c 'FACTORY_DISPATCH=1') command=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 [^ ]*bin/factory ') unnamed=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'deliberately does not name the marker') export=$(echo "$J" | grep -ci 'never export') rundirs=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'worktrees/')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `first=1 command=1 unnamed=1 export=1 rundirs=1`

#### Scenario: README says the final verifier run is listed as in flight
- WHEN `(R=$(tr '\n' ' ' < README.md | tr -s ' '); echo "stale=$(echo "$R" | grep -o 'does not list it as in flight' | grep -c .) listed=$(echo "$R" | grep -o 'lists it as in flight' | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `stale=0 listed=1`

#### Scenario: README no longer says the factory's capabilities never entered the spec store
- WHEN `(echo "bullet=$(grep -c 'Current truth for the factory itself' README.md) stale=$(grep -c 'never entered it' README.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `bullet=1 stale=0`

#### Scenario: The guard change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

## Current truth: harness-suite

# harness-suite

## Requirements

### Requirement: The harness suite runs mid-edit without loosening the lock
The harness's own test suite SHALL pass in a checkout that has an uncommitted edit under a harness path, and a store command on an instance's own store run from such a checkout MUST still be refused.

#### Scenario: The harness suite passes with an uncommitted harness edit
The command gives pytest its own temporary directory under `/tmp`, because four existing tests need one outside every repository and instance. Run it as written, whatever `TMPDIR` the caller has set; it removes that directory when it ends.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && P=$(mktemp -d /tmp/t0023-suite.XXXXXX) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && echo '# uncommitted edit' >> $T/c/factory/status.py && cd $T/c && TMPDIR=$P .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | tail -1; rm -rf "$P")`
- THEN it prints one line reporting a number of passed tests and no `failed` or `error`

#### Scenario: The uncommitted-edit refusal still holds on an instance's own store
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && echo '# uncommitted edit' >> $T/c/factory/status.py && git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $T/c/bin/factory init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && $T/c/bin/factory config >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$?"; head -1 $T/err | grep -o 'has uncommitted changes:$')`
- THEN it prints `exit=2`, then `has uncommitted changes:`

### Requirement: Existing ruling routes are unchanged
A ruling on a critic ESCALATE park SHALL still return the ticket to `ready-for-critic`.

#### Scenario: A ruling on a critic ESCALATE still returns the ticket to the critic

### Requirement: A re-plan returns a fully merged parent to its planner
`factory resolve <parent> --replan F` on a parked parent whose sub-tickets have all merged MUST move it to `ready-for-planner` with F as its next ruling, and the next planner input SHALL contain F and list each existing sub-ticket with its title and state; with any sub-ticket not merged it MUST refuse, naming that sub-ticket, and write nothing.

#### Scenario: A re-plan sends a parent whose sub-tickets all merged back to its planner with the note and the sub-ticket list

### Requirement: A redispatch sets aside only rows that did not pass
`factory resolve <id> --redispatch` MUST keep a reviewer row that is `APPROVE`, and the verifier and gate rows together when they are `VERIFIED` and `PASS`, and SHALL move every other row of that commit to `superseded-<n>/`.

#### Scenario: A redispatch after a killed reviewer keeps the verifier's passing rows

## Current truth: live-store-guard

# live-store-guard

## Requirements

### Requirement: Unmarked writes to a live store are refused while a role run is in flight there
While any run is in flight on an instance's own store, every `factory` command on that store except `ticket show`, `ticket join`, `results show`, `config`, `status parse`, `log tail` and `paths` (and any command given `--accept-harness`) MUST be refused with exit 2, writing nothing to the store, the instance or the repository, unless its environment has `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1`; the refusal SHALL name a throwaway `FACTORY_STATE` and SHALL NOT name the marker.

#### Scenario: Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the three fixture files written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names them reuses them)

- THEN it prints exactly `accept=2 store=unchanged`

### Requirement: Writes from inside a store's run directories or code checkouts are refused, marked or not
Every `factory` command on an instance's own store except the read-only list above MUST be refused with exit 2, writing nothing, when the caller's directory lies under that store's `runs/` or `worktrees/`, whether or not its environment has `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` and whether or not any run is in flight.

#### Scenario: Marked writes from a run's scratch directory or a worktree directory are refused, init included
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once.

- THEN it prints exactly `idle=1 new=2 decision=2 store=unchanged`

### Requirement: Reads, marked commands from outside the store, throwaway stores and idle stores stay open
While a run is in flight on the live store, the read-only commands SHALL succeed from anywhere, a command with `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` run from outside the store's `runs/` and `worktrees/` SHALL succeed as before, and a command on a throwaway store (`FACTORY_STATE` naming another store) SHALL NOT be fenced from any directory; with no run in flight, unmarked writes from outside those directories SHALL succeed as before.

#### Scenario: Read commands still answer while a run is in flight
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once.

- THEN it prints exactly `show=0 config=0 log=0 results=0 inside=0`

#### Scenario: A marked write from the repository root still writes while a run is in flight
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-inflight.sh && cd $T/tgt && FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 $B decision add T-0001 "marked line" >/dev/null 2>&1; d=$?; FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 $B run finish $R --status-override KILLED >/dev/null 2>&1; f=$?; echo "decision=$d finish=$f cleared=$($B ticket show T-0001 --json | tail -1 | grep -c '"in_flight": \[\]')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `decision=0 finish=0 cleared=1`

#### Scenario: A throwaway store is not fenced, even from a run's scratch directory
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-inflight.sh && (cd $T/tgt && FACTORY_STATE=$T/s $B init >/dev/null 2>&1); i=$?; cd $W && FACTORY_STATE=$T/s $B ticket new --file $T/req2.md >/dev/null 2>&1; n=$?; echo "init=$i new=$n")`
- THEN it prints exactly `init=0 new=0`

#### Scenario: With no run in flight, unmarked commands write as before
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-inflight.sh && FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 $B run finish $R --status-override KILLED >/dev/null 2>&1; $B ticket new --file $T/req2.md >/dev/null 2>&1; n=$?; $B decision add T-0001 "after the run" >/dev/null 2>&1; d=$?; echo "new=$n decision=$d")`
- THEN it prints exactly `new=0 decision=0`

### Requirement: The marker does not lift the harness lock
A command with `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` on an instance's own store MUST still be refused by the harness lock's uncommitted-edit check, with exit 2 and nothing written, whether or not a run is in flight.

#### Scenario: A marked write from a harness checkout with an uncommitted edit is still refused
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $T/c/bin/factory init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md && $T/c/bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null && $T/c/bin/factory run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null && echo '# uncommitted edit' >> $T/c/factory/status.py && S0=$(find $T/tgt/.factory -type f -exec cksum {} + | sort | cksum) && FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 $T/c/bin/factory decision add T-0001 x >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? lock=$(head -1 $T/err | grep -c 'has uncommitted changes:$') store=$([ "$(find $T/tgt/.factory -type f -exec cksum {} + | sort | cksum)" = "$S0" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `exit=2 lock=1 store=unchanged`

## Current truth: store-setup

# store-setup

## Requirements

### Requirement: Run records are exempt from whitespace checks
A store that `init` or `run start` has touched MUST hold a `.gitattributes` with the line `runs/** -whitespace`, so that `git diff --check` SHALL NOT report run records while it still reports every other store file.

#### Scenario: Run records in a store pass whitespace checks and other store files do not
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && git init -q -b main $T/r && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && FACTORY_STATE=$T/r/store bin/factory init >/dev/null && git -C $T/r add -A && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q -m store && mkdir -p $T/r/store/runs/run-0001-verifier && printf 'context \n x\n' > $T/r/store/runs/run-0001-verifier/diff.patch && git -C $T/r add -A && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q -m record && git -C $T/r diff --check HEAD~1 HEAD >/dev/null; echo "runs=$?"; printf 'x \n' > $T/r/store/notes.md && git -C $T/r add -A && git -C $T/r -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q -m notes && git -C $T/r diff --check HEAD~1 HEAD >/dev/null; echo "other=$?")`
- THEN it prints `runs=0`, then `other=2`

#### Scenario: A run start adds the whitespace rule to an existing store
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && bin/factory run start --role planner --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null && echo "rule=$(cat $FACTORY_STATE/.gitattributes 2>/dev/null | grep -cxF 'runs/** -whitespace')")`
- THEN it prints `rule=1`

### Requirement: No half instance, and a missing briefing refuses
`factory init` MUST refuse with exit 2, writing nothing, when it would create an instance while `FACTORY_STATE` names another store; `run compose` MUST refuse with exit 2, writing no input, when the instance has no `context.md`.

#### Scenario: init refuses to create an instance on a throwaway store and writes nothing
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && FACTORY_STATE=$T/s $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? instance=$([ -e $T/tgt/.factory ] && echo written || echo none) store=$([ -e $T/s ] && echo written || echo none) names_state=$(grep -c FACTORY_STATE $T/err)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 instance=none store=none names_state=1`

#### Scenario: A missing briefing refuses the compose with exit 2
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && rm .factory/context.md && export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md && $B ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null && $B run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null && $B run compose run-0001-triage >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$? input=$([ -e $T/s/runs/run-0001-triage/input.md ] && echo written || echo none) names_context=$(grep -c 'context.md' $T/err)")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 input=none names_context=1`

### Requirement: Relative environment paths resolve from the caller's directory
A relative `FACTORY_STATE`, `FACTORY_INSTANCE` or `FACTORY_REPO` MUST resolve against the directory the command was run from; an absolute value SHALL be used as given.

#### Scenario: Relative FACTORY_STATE, FACTORY_INSTANCE and FACTORY_REPO resolve against the caller's directory
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; F=$(cd tests/factory/fixtures/instance && pwd -P); s=$(cd $T && FACTORY_INSTANCE=$F FACTORY_STATE=rel/store $B paths | tail -1); i=$(cd $F/.. && FACTORY_INSTANCE=instance $B paths | tail -1); r=$(cd $T && FACTORY_INSTANCE=$F FACTORY_REPO=rel $B paths | tail -1); echo "state=$(echo "$s" | grep -cF "\"state\": \"$T/rel/store\"") instance=$(echo "$i" | grep -cF "\"instance\": \"$F\"") repo=$(echo "$r" | grep -cF "\"state\": \"$T/rel/.factory/state\"")")`
- THEN it prints `state=1 instance=1 repo=1`

#### Scenario: An absolute FACTORY_STATE is used as given
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; F=$(cd tests/factory/fixtures/instance && pwd -P); cd / && echo "absolute=$(FACTORY_INSTANCE=$F FACTORY_STATE=$T/abs $B paths | tail -1 | grep -cF "\"state\": \"$T/abs\"")")`
- THEN it prints `absolute=1`

## Current truth: sub-ticket-planning

# sub-ticket-planning

## Requirements

### Requirement: A later plan's sub-tickets continue the parent's numbering
`factory subticket add` on a parent that already has sub-tickets MUST number the new ones from the next free index, SHALL accept a `Depends on:` line naming an existing sub-ticket, and MUST refuse a plan whose head line reuses an existing sub-ticket's id, writing nothing.

#### Scenario: A later plan's sub-tickets take the next free ids and may depend on a merged sibling
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-closed.sh && printf 'ST-1 / Fix the bypass\nDepends on: T-0001.2\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan2.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan2.md 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | grep -o '"id": "[^"]*"\|"depends_on": \[[^]]*\]'; bin/factory ticket ready-implementers T-0001 | tail -1 | grep -o '"ready": \[[^]]*\]')`
- THEN it prints `"id": "T-0001.3"`, then `"depends_on": ["T-0001.2"]`, then `"ready": ["T-0001.3"]`

#### Scenario: A plan that reuses an existing sub-ticket id is refused and writes nothing
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-closed.sh && printf 'T-0001.1 / Again\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan3.md; bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan3.md >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "exit=$? $(ls $FACTORY_STATE/tickets | tr '\n' ' ')")`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 T-0001.1.yaml T-0001.2.yaml T-0001.yaml `

## Decision log (decisions.md): standing decisions, read-only

2026-10-04 T-0023 `resolve --ruling F` also accepts a park whose reason starts with `BLOCKED`. It writes F as the next `approvals/<id>/ruling-<n>.md` and returns the sub-ticket to `ready-for-implementer` at the same round.
2026-10-04 T-0023 `resolve PARENT --replan F` moves a parked parent whose sub-tickets have all merged to `ready-for-planner`, with F as its next ruling. The planner receives F and plans the fix. Rejected: the requester's `--replan --file <plan>` straight to `planned`. It needs a new routing edge, which the queue policy does not count as small. It would also skip the planner. `dev/build-harness.spec.md` already sends a re-plan through the planner.
2026-10-04 T-0023 On a re-plan, the planner's input lists the parent's existing sub-tickets, each with its title and state. The human's note F therefore needs to say only what to fix. Rejected: asking the human to restate in F what has merged, which the store already knows.
2026-10-04 T-0023 Sub-tickets that a later plan adds take the next free ids under the parent, and their `Depends on:` lines may name the parent's existing sub-tickets. A plan head line that reuses an existing sub-ticket's id is refused. Rejected: honouring explicit non-colliding ids, a second numbering rule that the planner's free-form ids would make ambiguous.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A park reason is never blank. When the clerk relays an empty stderr, the workflows use the refusal's JSON `error`, and failing that `exit <n>, no JSON on stdout` or `exit <n>, no error text`. Rejected: editing each of the 26 reason sites.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A redispatch sets aside a checker's rows only when they did not pass. The reviewer's row is kept when it is `APPROVE`. The verifier and gate rows are kept together when they are `VERIFIED` and `PASS`, because one verifier run writes both. The build then runs only the checkers with no row on that commit. After an implementer run it still runs both. Rejected: a `--roles` flag on redispatch, which no reported case needs.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The store gets a `.gitattributes` holding `runs/** -whitespace`. `init` and every `run start` write it the way they already write `.gitignore`. Rejected: rewriting committed records, and excluding the store path inside each gate command.
2026-10-04 T-0023 `init` refuses, with exit 2 and nothing written, to create an instance while `FACTORY_STATE` names another store. A compose with no `context.md` refuses with exit 2. Rejected: writing every instance piece from a throwaway-store `init`. That contradicts the rule that such a run initialises only that store.
2026-10-04 T-0023 A relative `FACTORY_INSTANCE`, `FACTORY_STATE` or `FACTORY_REPO` resolves against the caller's directory: `FACTORY_CWD`, else the working directory.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The suite's own-store cases that are not about the uncommitted-edit refusal run the CLI through a test-only launcher that stubs that one check. The refusal itself keeps its tests on a clone's real `bin/factory`. Rejected: a switch the production CLI honours, which would loosen the check. Also rejected: running every case from a committed snapshot of the working tree, which changes every assertion that names this checkout's revision or paths.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The suite scenario gives pytest a fresh temporary directory under `/tmp` and removes it afterwards. Four existing tests need a temporary directory outside every repository, and an agent's scratch directory lies inside this one. The scenario states this in its command, so no role has to choose between its scratch rule and a valid run. Rejected: fixing those four tests in this ticket, which is beyond H8 and needs its own design (Out-of-scope observations).
2026-10-04 T-0023 The workflow-script fixes are checked by acceptance scenarios that run the scripts under node with a stub clerk. They get no suite test, because the suite does not need node today and adding that would change what the gate needs.
2026-10-04 T-0023 The change is built as four seams (design.md, "Size and seams"). They share one changelog entry, 51.
2026-10-04 T-0024 T-0024: instance B keeps the spec store created 2026-10-04 by run-0196; its tickets close by archive into current truth (operator)
2026-10-04 T-0024 While a role run is in flight on a live store, a human or runner writes it by prefixing that one command with FACTORY_DISPATCH=1; README documents it and the refusal text never names it (operator)
2026-10-04 T-0024 Instance B keeps the spec store that run-0196 created. Its tickets close by archive into current truth, and `decisions.md` keeps reaching the spec writer, critic and planner. The operator decided this in the first answer to this ticket, and it is already recorded in `decisions.md`. This is a standing decision. This ticket touches README, so it also corrects README's stale "never entered it" line, as that answer directs.
2026-10-04 T-0024 While a role run is in flight on a live store, the operator or a runner session writes it by putting `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` in front of that one command. README documents this. The refusal text never names the marker. The operator decided this in the same answer, and it is already recorded in `decisions.md`. This is a standing decision for every runner session, including the Driver session that runs the Nanobot fork's instance (instance A).
2026-10-04 T-0024 A write is refused, marker or not and run in flight or not, when the caller's directory lies under the own store's `runs/` or `worktrees/`. The operator's gate review asked for this rule. Rejected: applying it only while a run is in flight, because a process a role left running in its run directory would then write freely once the store went idle. Rejected: letting the marker lift it, because the rule exists so that a copied or exported marker does not help from there. This is a standing decision: the operator and runner sessions run store writes from outside the store.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The location rule is checked first, then the marker, then the in-flight list.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The in-flight rule acts only on an instance's own store, and only while at least one run is in flight on any ticket of that store. Rejected: refusing every unmarked write at all times, as the requester proposed. The operator would then need the marker on every command and would export it in the shell, and every role run started from that shell would inherit it. The operator's decision on the marker assumes unmarked writes when nothing is in flight.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The in-flight rule checks every ticket's in-flight list, not only the calling ticket's. The tool cannot tell which run, if any, is calling.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The marker is the environment variable `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1`. Both workflow scripts put it in front of every clerk command. Rejected: the requester's exemption for "a human's `--by`". Human commands have no `--by`, and `ticket transition` requires one from everyone.
2026-10-04 T-0024 A write is every command except a fixed read-only list: `ticket show`, `ticket join`, `results show`, `config`, `status parse`, `log tail` and `paths`. Any command given `--accept-harness` is a write, because it rewrites the lock and logs. A new command is fenced until someone adds it to the list. Rejected: the requester's list of ten write commands. It misses writes such as `ticket set`, `ticket park`, `ticket head`, `ticket ready-implementers`, `ticket parent-check`, `run compose` and `spec add`.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The refusal exits 2 and writes nothing. Its text is `role runs may not write the live store (<detail>); use a throwaway FACTORY_STATE`. The detail is `<store>; in flight: <run ids>` for the in-flight rule and `<store>; called from inside its runs/` (or `worktrees/`) for the location rule. The advice is meant for a role. The operator learns the marker from README.
2026-10-04 T-0024 A run left in flight by a dead workflow keeps the in-flight rule up. The operator clears it with a marked `run finish <run> --status-override KILLED`, run from the repository root, and README says so. Rejected: a timeout that drops the fence by itself. A long run that is still working would lose the fence.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The fence guards against accidents, not against a determined agent. It is not a security boundary. A role working from outside the store that copies the marker from the workflow scripts or README still gets through. That is recorded under Risk rather than designed around. Isolating role runs at the operating-system level is issue #37.
2026-10-04 T-0024 The fence is checked before the harness lock, the check that each instance runs only the harness revision it has accepted. A fenced command is refused before it reaches the lock, so a fenced `--accept-harness` rewrites nothing. A marked command still meets the lock and its uncommitted-edit refusal unchanged, so the marker cannot be used to get past the lock. Rejected: checking the fence after the lock, because `--accept-harness` rewrites the lock inside that check, so a fenced acceptance would write before it was refused.
2026-10-04 T-0024 Part B (a preamble line) is cut. The incident came from the test suite, not from a command the role typed, so a preamble line would not have stopped it. The refusal text gives the same advice at the moment it matters.
2026-10-04 T-0024 Part C (the tripwire on the store root) is cut. Role runs legitimately write their own run directory in the store (`output.md`, `scratch/`). Clerk commands for other tickets' runs also write the store during a run. A comparison of the store root therefore cannot tell whose write it saw. The fence refuses the write before it happens.
2026-10-04 T-0022 Removing clearly redundant work (a step, run or check that cannot change any outcome) is pre-approved, provided every refusal the pipeline gives today still fires (operator, 2026-10-04: 'slashing clearly redundant work is always going to be OK, if we trust our process')
2026-10-04 T-0022 Under a sub-ticket's Tests to change, the planner may list tests an earlier sibling of the same parent added, with a harness check that each first appeared in a sibling's merge; pre-existing tests still need the approved spec (operator, #40)
