## Context for this run (composed by the harness, not part of the request)

Repository: `nanobot`, the lionbot fork. This checkout is the TARGET generation: branch
`feat/lionbot-v3` at `~/dev/nanobot-upstream` (upstream base tag `lionbot-v3-base`). The
REFERENCE generation is the production fork at `~/dev/nanobot` (branch `feat/lionbot-next`,
"blue"): read it only to observe what the feature does today; never copy its test names,
line numbers or commit SHAs into a spec. Never read or write `~/.nanobot/` (live credentials).

Running things here: `uv run <cmd>` from the repo root (never pip). Tests run serially with
`PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 COLUMNS=200 TERM=dumb NO_COLOR=1 uv run pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider <path>`.
Lint: `uv run ruff check nanobot/`. Acceptance commands must be runnable as written on this checkout.

The request is a legacy "faux spec": a document that mixes the durable intent (what the
operator needs the bot to do) with one generation's implementation record (test names,
file:line citations, commit SHAs, ledger status, verification narrative, a prior
implementation profile). Treat the implementation record as evidence of what the reference
generation did, not as requirements. Carry forward only what the requester needs; anything
that can be re-derived from the code at build time does not belong in the spec. Where the
request's status says the capability is already built on this checkout, verify that before
writing NEW criteria; a NEW criterion that already passes proves nothing.

Output: write your complete output, in your role's required format and ending with the
STATUS / CONFIDENCE / ESCALATIONS trailer, to the file named under "Output file" below. That
is the only file you may create or modify. Then return the same text as your final message.
