## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The driver takes a ticket through intake on the intake script's route
`factory drive TICKET --phase intake` MUST take a ticket from its stored intake state to the same end state, with the same ticket records, runs, result rows and log events, apart from ids and times, as `factory/workflows/intake.js` does when given the same role outputs, and it SHALL start no process other than one `claude` per role run.

#### Scenario: The driver takes the intake fixtures through the same routes as the intake script
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `git` and `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell. This scenario also needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" (current truth, human-resolution) run once.
- GIVEN the six fixture files written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names them reuses them)

```sh
cat > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0040-claude <<'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env node
// Stands in for `claude`. Run from a role run's directory (runs/run-NNNN-<role>). Appends one JSON line
// to $T40_LOG: its argv, its working directory, its pid and FACTORY_DISPATCH. Plays the next entry of
// its role's list in $T40_PLAYS (the last one repeats), counted in $T40_LOG.n-<role>. An entry may
// first sleep ("sleep": seconds), then:
//   {"write": "<STATUS>"}  writes output.md (a Commit: line with the run's head when meta.yaml has one;
//                          "Gate suite: PASS" for a verifier) and replies with the same text;
//   {"say": "<text>"}      writes nothing and replies with <text>;
//   {"fail": "<text>"}     writes nothing, replies with is_error and <text>, and exits 1.
// The reply is one JSON object on stdout, shaped like `claude -p --output-format json`. Each finished
// call appends "<start> <end>" (seconds) to $T40_LOG.times.

### Requirement: The driver takes an approved ticket through the build on the build script's route
`factory drive TICKET --phase build` MUST take an approved parent from its stored build state to the same end state, with the same ticket records, runs, result rows and log events, apart from ids and times, as `factory/workflows/build.js` does when given the same role outputs.

#### Scenario: The driver takes the build fixtures through the same routes as the build script
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" (current truth, human-resolution) and "The driver takes the intake fixtures through the same routes as the intake script" run once.
- WHEN `(for P in '{"implementer": [{"write": "READY-FOR-REVIEW"}], "reviewer": [{"write": "APPROVE"}], "verifier": [{"write": "VERIFIED"}]}' '{"implementer": [{"write": "READY-FOR-REVIEW"}], "reviewer": [{"write": "REQUEST-CHANGES"}], "verifier": [{"write": "VERIFIED"}]}' '{"implementer": [{"write": "READY-FOR-REVIEW"}], "reviewer": [{"say": ""}], "verifier": [{"write": "SPEC-DEFECT"}]}' '{"implementer": [{"write": "BLOCKED"}]}'; do (PHASE=build; . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0040-parity.sh); done)`

### Requirement: Each role run is one headless claude process with its role's prompt, model and tool limits
For every role run, the driver MUST start exactly one `claude` process from the run's directory, without `FACTORY_DISPATCH` in its environment, with argv `-p` and a prompt naming only the run's input and output files, then `--model` with the run's model, `--output-format json`, `--permission-mode auto`, `--append-system-prompt-file <run>/system-prompt.txt`, `--tools` and `--allowedTools`, and no `--bare`. Its `Edit` allow rules SHALL cover only the run's `output.md`, its `scratch/`, the temporary directory and, for the implementer alone, its worktree, and only the implementer SHALL have the `Edit` tool.

#### Scenario: Each role runs as one claude process with its prompt, model and tool limits
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" (current truth, human-resolution) and "The driver takes the intake fixtures through the same routes as the intake script" run once.

- THEN it prints exactly `critic ok`, `spec_writer ok`, `triage ok`, `implementer ok`, `reviewer ok`, `verifier ok`, `verifier ok`, one per line

### Requirement: A role process's reply is recorded with its run
After each role process ends, the run's directory MUST hold the process's stdout as `reply.json`, and the run's `meta.yaml` SHALL record its `session_id`, `total_cost_usd`, `num_turns` and `usage` under `claude:`.

#### Scenario: Each role run records its process's reply
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" (current truth, human-resolution) and "The driver takes the intake fixtures through the same routes as the intake script" run once.
- WHEN `(P='{"triage": [{"write": "ACCEPT"}], "spec_writer": [{"write": "READY-FOR-CRITIC"}], "critic": [{"write": "APPROVE"}]}'; PHASE=intake; . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0040-parity.sh >/dev/null; .venv/bin/python -c 'import json,pathlib,sys,yaml; s=pathlib.Path(sys.argv[1]); ms=[yaml.safe_load(p.read_text()) for p in sorted(s.glob("runs/*/meta.yaml"))]; ok=lambda m,c: c.get("session_id")=="stub-"+m["run_id"] and c.get("total_cost_usd")==0.25 and c.get("num_turns")==1 and (c.get("usage") or {}).get("output_tokens")==5 and json.loads((s/"runs"/m["run_id"]/"reply.json").read_text())["session_id"]==c["session_id"]; print(" ".join("%s=%s" % (m["role"], "ok" if ok(m, m.get("claude") or {}) else "missing") for m in ms) or "none")' $(cat $D/drive.state))`
- THEN it prints exactly `triage=ok spec_writer=ok critic=ok`

### Requirement: The checkers run at once, and sub-tickets run concurrently up to a limit
The driver MUST run a head's reviewer and verifier as two concurrent processes, and SHALL build ready sub-tickets concurrently, at most `--parallel N` at a time, 2 when the option is not given.

#### Scenario: The checkers run at once, and sub-tickets up to the parallel limit
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" (current truth, human-resolution) and "The driver takes the intake fixtures through the same routes as the intake script" run once. Two sub-tickets with no dependency wait at `checks-in-flight`, each on its own commit; every checker sleeps 4 seconds, and the verifier's SPEC-DEFECT parks each one.
- WHEN `(for par in 1 default; do (. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && printf 'ST-1 / One\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n\nST-2 / Two\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan.md >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to planned --by t >/dev/null && for i in 1 2; do git -C $T23/t checkout -qb factory/T-0001.$i main && echo $i > $T23/t/f$i.txt && git -C $T23/t add f$i.txt && git -C $T23/t -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -qm w$i && git -C $T23/t checkout -q main && bin/factory ticket set T-0001.$i status=checks-in-flight branch=factory/T-0001.$i head=$(git -C $T23/t rev-parse factory/T-0001.$i) >/dev/null; done; export T40_LOG=$T23/claude.log T40_PLAYS='{"reviewer": [{"sleep": 4, "write": "APPROVE"}], "verifier": [{"sleep": 4, "write": "SPEC-DEFECT"}]}'; : > $T40_LOG; : > $T40_LOG.times; A=; [ $par = 1 ] && A='--parallel 1'; PATH=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0040-bin:$PATH bin/factory drive T-0001 --phase build $A >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "parallel=$par: calls=$(grep -c . $T40_LOG) max=$(.venv/bin/python -c 'import sys; t=[tuple(map(float, l.split())) for l in open(sys.argv[1])]; print(max([sum(a <= s < b for a, b in t) for s, _ in t] or [0]))' $T40_LOG.times) $(bin/factory ticket show T-0001.1 | sed -n 's/^status: //p') $(bin/factory ticket show T-0001.2 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')"); done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `parallel=1: calls=4 max=2 parked parked`, then `parallel=default: calls=4 max=4 parked parked`

### Requirement: The driver reports each step on one line and in a status file
Every line the driver prints on stdout before its last MUST have the form `<ticket id> "<title>": <step>`, naming the ticket the step concerns, a sub-ticket included. The last line SHALL be the result as one JSON object, and the store's `drive/<ticket>.yaml` SHALL hold the ticket, its title, the role processes still running and, once the driver ends, its result under `ended`; the store's `.gitignore` SHALL exclude `drive/`.

#### Scenario: Every intake step line names its ticket and title, and the status file shows the end
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" (current truth, human-resolution) and "The driver takes the intake fixtures through the same routes as the intake script" run once.
- WHEN `(P='{"triage": [{"write": "ACCEPT"}], "spec_writer": [{"write": "READY-FOR-CRITIC"}], "critic": [{"write": "REVISE"}, {"write": "APPROVE"}]}'; PHASE=intake; . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0040-parity.sh >/dev/null; O=$D/drive.out; echo "steps=$([ $(sed '$d' $O | grep -c .) -ge 10 ] && echo yes || echo no) untagged=$(sed '$d' $O | grep -vcE '^T-0001 "Fixture": ') last=$(tail -1 $O | grep -c '"state": "awaiting-spec-gate"') status=$(.venv/bin/python -c 'import sys,yaml; d=yaml.safe_load(open(sys.argv[1])); print(d["ticket"], d["title"], d["ended"]["state"], len(d["running"]))' $(cat $D/drive.state)/drive/T-0001.yaml 2>/dev/null) ignored=$(cat $(cat $D/drive.state)/.gitignore 2>/dev/null | grep -cx 'drive/')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `steps=yes untagged=0 last=1 status=T-0001 Fixture awaiting-spec-gate 0 ignored=1`

#### Scenario: Build step lines name the sub-ticket they concern
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" (current truth, human-resolution) and "The driver takes the intake fixtures through the same routes as the intake script" run once.
- WHEN `(P='{"implementer": [{"write": "READY-FOR-REVIEW"}], "reviewer": [{"write": "APPROVE"}], "verifier": [{"write": "VERIFIED"}]}'; PHASE=build; . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0040-parity.sh >/dev/null; O=$D/drive.out; echo "untagged=$(sed '$d' $O | grep -vcE '^T-0001(\.1)?

- THEN it prints exactly `untagged=0 sub=yes last=1`

### Requirement: A stopped driver ends its role processes and resumes from the stored state
On SIGTERM or SIGINT the driver MUST end every role process it started, record each of its in-flight runs as `KILLED`, leave the ticket in its stored state unparked with nothing in flight, print a last line with `"stopped"` and exit with 128 plus the signal number; `factory drive TICKET` run again SHALL continue from the stored state, choosing the phase from that state when `--phase` is not given.

#### Scenario: A stopped driver ends its role process, records the run as killed and resumes from the stored state

### Requirement: The driver marks its own store calls, never its role processes, and passes a configured effort
`factory drive` MUST be refused by the live-store fence like any write, so that unmarked it is refused while a run is in flight on the target's own store and it is refused from inside that store's `runs/` even when marked. Once started, its store calls SHALL carry the dispatcher marker, its role processes SHALL NOT, and a role with a level under `effort:` in `instance.yaml` SHALL get `--effort <level>`.

#### Scenario: The driver marks its own store calls, never its roles', and passes a configured effort
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" (current truth, live-store-guard) and "The driver takes the intake fixtures through the same routes as the intake script" run once. T-0001's triage run stays in flight throughout; T-0002 is driven.

### Requirement: The Workflow scripts keep working beside the driver
`factory/workflows/intake.js` and `factory/workflows/build.js` SHALL still take a ticket through their routes unchanged until a later ticket retires them.

#### Scenario: The Workflow scripts still take both fixtures to the end of their routes
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" (current truth, human-resolution) and "The driver takes the intake fixtures through the same routes as the intake script" run once.
