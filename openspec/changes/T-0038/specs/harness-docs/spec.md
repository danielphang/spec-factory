## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The documents record superseded plans
`docs/design.md` SHALL say, in its rule for a sub-ticket closed by the human, that a new plan from a later approved version supersedes the earlier plan's unmerged sub-tickets. `dev/build-harness.spec.md` SHALL describe the `superseded` list of `ready-implementers`. `README.md` SHALL carry a "Re-plan after a re-spec" bullet. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #77, numbered without a gap. The change MUST NOT touch any prompt copy, workflow script or agent template, and MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design doc, build spec, README and changelog record superseded plans
- WHEN `(echo "design=$(grep 'sub-ticket closed by the human' docs/design.md | grep -c supersede) build-spec=$(grep 'ready-implementers PARENT' dev/build-harness.spec.md | grep -c superseded) readme=$(grep -c '^- \*\*Re-plan after a re-spec\.\*\*' README.md) changelog=$(grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #77 ' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e superseded -e planned_from -e 'Depends on' | sort -u | grep -c .) $(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design=1 build-spec=1 readme=1 changelog=3 CONTIGUOUS`

#### Scenario: The superseded-plan change leaves prompts, workflows and agents alone and adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(echo "whitespace=$(git diff --check main...HEAD >/dev/null && echo ok || echo bad) untouched=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts factory/workflows agents | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `whitespace=ok untouched=0`
