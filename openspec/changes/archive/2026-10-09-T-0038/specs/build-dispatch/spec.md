## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The build counts only the current plan's sub-tickets
The build MUST NOT park a parent for a superseded sub-ticket the human closed, and SHALL dispatch the current plan's ready sub-tickets. A closed sub-ticket of the current plan MUST still park the parent with `sub-ticket closed by a human: <id>`.

#### Scenario: The build of a re-planned parent dispatches the new sub-ticket instead of parking on the old one
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A test file a merged sibling added may be listed, and a mention outside Tests to change is ignored", "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "After a re-spec and a re-plan, only the new plan's sub-tickets count and the old records are kept" run once. In `t0022-build.mjs` every role run returns an empty string, so the implementer of the dispatched sub-ticket ends EMPTY-OUTPUT twice.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0038-respec.sh && printf 'ST-1 / Redo\nDepends on: T-0001.1\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan2.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan2.md >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to planned --by t >/dev/null; node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-build.mjs)`
- THEN it prints exactly `park T-0001.4: EMPTY-OUTPUT from implementer`

#### Scenario: A sub-ticket of the current plan that a human closed still parks the parent
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A test file a merged sibling added may be listed, and a mention outside Tests to change is ignored" and "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && printf 'ST-1 / First\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n\nST-2 / Second\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan1.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan1.md >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to planned --by t >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket transition T-0001.2 --to closed --by t >/dev/null; node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-build.mjs)`
- THEN it prints exactly `park T-0001: sub-ticket closed by a human: T-0001.2`

### Requirement: A parent's final check and close count only the current plan's sub-tickets
`factory ticket parent-check` SHALL move a planned parent to `ready-for-parent-verify` when every current sub-ticket has merged, and `ticket transition <parent> --to closed` MUST accept a VERIFIED final check whatever its superseded sub-tickets' states.

#### Scenario: With the new plan merged, the re-planned parent reaches its final check and closes
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "After a re-spec and a re-plan, only the new plan's sub-tickets count and the old records are kept" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0038-respec.sh && printf 'ST-1 / Redo\nDepends on: T-0001.1\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan2.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan2.md >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to planned --by t >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket set T-0001.4 status=merged >/dev/null; echo "check: $(bin/factory ticket parent-check T-0001 | tail -1 | grep -o '"state": "[^"]*"')"; R=$(bin/factory run start --role verifier --ticket T-0001 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'); if [ -n "$R" ]; then H=$(sed -n "s/^head: '*\([0-9a-f]*\).*/\1/p" $FACTORY_STATE/runs/$R/meta.yaml); printf "Commit: $H\nGate suite: PASS\nSTATUS: VERIFIED\nCONFIDENCE: high, fixture\nESCALATIONS: none\n" > $FACTORY_STATE/runs/$R/output.md; bin/factory run finish $R >/dev/null 2>&1; fi; bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to closed --by t >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "close=$? $(bin/factory ticket show T-0001 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `check: "state": "ready-for-parent-verify"`, then `close=0 closed`
