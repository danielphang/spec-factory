## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The implementer and verifier leave declared protected paths out of ESCALATIONS
The system prompt of every implementer and verifier run SHALL say that a protected path the sub-ticket declares is not an escalation, that the code reviewer lists declared paths once for each head it reviews, that the role may name them but not under ESCALATIONS, and that a protected path the sub-ticket does not declare still goes under ESCALATIONS.

#### Scenario: Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the fixture file written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

```sh
cat > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh <<'EOF'
# Sourced from the repo root of the checkout under test. Defines `prompt <role>`: starts one run of
# that role (implementer, reviewer or verifier) on a scratch target with a throwaway store, and
# prints the run's system prompt on one line, runs of spaces squeezed.
T29=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B29=$PWD/bin/factory
git init -q -b main $T29/tgt && git -C $T29/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init
(cd $T29/tgt && $B29 init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1)
printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T29/req.md
(cd $T29/tgt && FACTORY_STATE=$T29/s $B29 ticket new --file $T29/req.md >/dev/null)
prompt() (
  cd $T29/tgt && export FACTORY_STATE=$T29/s
  case $1 in
    implementer) $B29 ticket set T-0001 status=ready-for-implementer 'in_flight=[]' >/dev/null ;;
    *) $B29 ticket set T-0001 status=checks-in-flight 'in_flight=[]' head=$(git rev-parse HEAD) >/dev/null ;;
  esac
  R=$($B29 run start --role $1 --ticket T-0001 --model opus 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
  tr '\n' ' ' < $T29/s/runs/${R:-none}/system-prompt.txt 2>/dev/null | tr -s ' '
)
EOF
```

- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh && for r in implementer verifier; do P=$(prompt $r); echo "$r declared=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'A protected path the sub-ticket declares is not an escalation') notunder=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'but not under ESCALATIONS') undeclared=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'still goes under ESCALATIONS when the sub-ticket does not declare it')"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer declared=1 notunder=1 undeclared=1`, then `verifier declared=1 notunder=1 undeclared=1`

### Requirement: Every role still escalates an undeclared protected path, and the code reviewer still lists declared ones
The system prompts of implementer, code reviewer and verifier runs MUST still carry the preamble's rule to escalate a protected path that the approved spec's Risk section does not declare, and the code reviewer's prompt MUST still carry check 6 unchanged.

#### Scenario: All three run prompts keep the undeclared-path rule and the reviewer keeps check 6
Needs the GIVEN block of "Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh && u="a protected path the approved spec's Risk section does not declare"; for r in implementer reviewer verifier; do echo "$r undeclared=$(prompt $r | grep -cF "$u")"; done; echo "check6=$(prompt reviewer | grep -cF '6. Protected paths touched? If the sub-ticket does not declare them, ESCALATE. If it does, list them under ESCALATIONS')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer undeclared=1`, `reviewer undeclared=1`, `verifier undeclared=1`, `check6=1`, one per line
