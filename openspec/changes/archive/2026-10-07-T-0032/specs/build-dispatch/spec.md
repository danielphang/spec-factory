## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A role run that leaves no output is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT
When a role run ends without an output file, or with a blank one, whatever the agent call returned, `run finish` MUST record it as `EMPTY-OUTPUT` and never as `KILLED`. The workflow MUST keep the agent's non-blank last message as that run's `last-message.md` and re-dispatch the same role once. A second `EMPTY-OUTPUT` in a row SHALL park the ticket as `EMPTY-OUTPUT from <role>`, with no result row for that run.

#### Scenario: A reviewer that ends its turn waiting on its own commands is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT beside the verifier's passing rows
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `git` and `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell. This scenario needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- GIVEN the two fixture files written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names them reuses them)

```sh
cat > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-checks.sh <<'EOF'
# Sourced from the repo root after t0023-parent.sh: T-0001 is planned as one sub-ticket, T-0001.1,
# whose branch factory/T-0001.1 holds one commit; T-0001.1 is at checks-in-flight on that head $H,
# with no result rows, so the build runs both checkers on it.
printf 'ST-1 / Do it\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan.md

// and t0032-checks.sh: runs factory/workflows/build.js on parent T-0001 of the store $FACTORY_STATE.
// Each clerk command runs for real (sh -c, from this checkout, environment unchanged). Each role
// run plays the next entry of its role's list in <plays> (the last one repeats):
//   {"say": "<text>"}     returns <text> (or null) as its final message and writes no output file;
//   {"write": "<STATUS>"} writes an output with the run's head as its Commit: line (and, for the
//                         verifier, "Gate suite: PASS") and that STATUS, and returns the same text.
// Prints each park, as `park <id>: <reason>`.

- WHEN `(M="Both suite runs are still in progress; I'll write the review once the monitor reports their final lines."; . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-checks.sh && node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-build.mjs "{\"reviewer\": [{\"say\": \"$M\"}], \"verifier\": [{\"write\": \"VERIFIED\"}]}"; for r in reviewer verifier; do echo "$r: $(for d in $(ls -d $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-$r); do sed -n 's/^status: //p' $d/meta.yaml; done | tr '\n' ' ')"; done; echo "kept=$(find $FACTORY_STATE/runs -path '*-reviewer/last-message.md' -exec grep -lxF "$M" {} + | grep -c .) $(bin/factory results show T-0001.1 | tail -1 | grep -o '"rows": {[^}]*}')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `park T-0001.1: EMPTY-OUTPUT from reviewer`, then `reviewer: EMPTY-OUTPUT EMPTY-OUTPUT ` (two reviewer runs, both empty), then `verifier: VERIFIED `, then `kept=2 "rows": {"ci": "PASS", "verifier": "VERIFIED"}` (both last messages kept verbatim, apostrophe included; no reviewer row, so a `--redispatch` re-runs only the reviewer)

#### Scenario: One empty reviewer run followed by a real one routes on the real one
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "A reviewer that ends its turn waiting on its own commands is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT beside the verifier's passing rows" run once. The first reviewer call returns `null`; the verifier's SPEC-DEFECT gives the join a fixed stop.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-checks.sh && node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-build.mjs '{"reviewer": [{"say": null}, {"write": "APPROVE"}], "verifier": [{"write": "SPEC-DEFECT"}]}'; echo "reviewer: $(for d in $(ls -d $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-reviewer); do sed -n 's/^status: //p' $d/meta.yaml; done | tr '\n' ' ')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `park T-0001.1: SPEC-DEFECT from verifier`, then `reviewer: EMPTY-OUTPUT APPROVE `

#### Scenario: An implementer that returns nothing twice parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT
Needs the GIVEN block of "A test file a merged sibling added may be listed, and a mention outside Tests to change is ignored" run once. In that fixture every role run returns an empty string.
- WHEN `(E=tests/test_interim.py; . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-sib.sh && node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-build.mjs; echo "implementer: $(for d in $(ls -d $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-implementer); do sed -n 's/^status: //p' $d/meta.yaml; done | tr '\n' ' ')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `park T-0001.2: EMPTY-OUTPUT from implementer`, then `implementer: EMPTY-OUTPUT EMPTY-OUTPUT `

#### Scenario: An intake role's second empty output in a row parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once. The stub store answers every `run finish` with `EMPTY-OUTPUT`.
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/intake.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-triage", "round": {"spec": 0}}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "run_id": "run-0009-x", "status": "EMPTY-OUTPUT", "escalations": []}}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: triage`, then `start: triage`, then `park: EMPTY-OUTPUT from triage`

### Requirement: A role run that writes its output runs once and routes on its STATUS
A role run whose output file holds a STATUS MUST NOT be re-dispatched, and the build SHALL route on that STATUS as before.

#### Scenario: A reviewer that writes its output runs once
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "A reviewer that ends its turn waiting on its own commands is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT beside the verifier's passing rows" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-checks.sh && node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-build.mjs '{"reviewer": [{"write": "APPROVE"}], "verifier": [{"write": "SPEC-DEFECT"}]}'; echo "reviewer: $(for d in $(ls -d $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-reviewer); do sed -n 's/^status: //p' $d/meta.yaml; done | tr '\n' ' ')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `park T-0001.1: SPEC-DEFECT from verifier`, then `reviewer: APPROVE `
