## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The spec writer and the critic carry the turn-economy rules
Every copy of the spec writer prompt SHALL tell it to batch independent reads and commands, read line ranges once grep has found them, keep long output in a scratch file, and write the spec in as few writes as it can. Every copy of the critic prompt SHALL carry the same reading rules, its minimum spot-check, a rule that it runs no test suite, the rule for picking an acceptance command, a sentence allowing a small experiment in its scratch directory to confirm a finding, and the rule that turns a claim needing a suite run or a build of the change into a finding or a question; it MUST NOT cap a claim at a number of paths and commands or forbid a clone, worktree or prototype. Each design block MUST stay byte-identical to its `docs/prompts/` copy, and each run copy SHALL differ from it only as it did on `main`.

#### Scenario: Every critic copy drops the cap and the no-build rule and keeps the rest; every writer copy keeps its rules
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); Q=$(printf '\140\140\140'); printf '%s\n' 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn' 'read that line range, not the whole file' 'to a file in your scratch directory and grep or tail it' > $T/both; { cat $T/both; echo 'Write the spec in as few writes as you can'; } > $T/spec_writer; { cat $T/both; printf '%s\n' 'Spot-check at least 2 cited paths and 1 acceptance command yourself' 'Run no test suite' 'Pick an acceptance command that runs no test suite' 'small experiment in your scratch directory' 'is a finding for the writer, or a question'; } > $T/critic; printf '%s\n' 'Ground any one claim' 'build nothing' 'no clone, worktree or prototype' > $T/gone; for r in "2. Spec writer|02-spec-writer.md|spec_writer" "3. Spec critic|03-spec-critic.md|critic"; do h=${r%%|*}; x=${r#*|}; c=${x%%|*}; f=${x#*|}; git show main:factory/prompts/$f.md > $T/a; git show main:docs/prompts/$c > $T/b; echo "$f copy=$(awk -v h="## $h" -v q="$Q" '$0==h{s=1;next} s&&$0==q"text"{p=1;next} p&&$0==q{exit} p' docs/design.md | cmp -s - docs/prompts/$c && echo SAME || echo DIFF) doc=$(tr '\n' ' ' < docs/prompts/$c | tr -s ' ' | grep -oF -f $T/$f | sort -u | grep -c .)/$(grep -c . $T/$f) run=$(tr '\n' ' ' < factory/prompts/$f.md | tr -s ' ' | grep -oF -f $T/$f | sort -u | grep -c .)/$(grep -c . $T/$f) gone=$(for g in docs/prompts/$c factory/prompts/$f.md; do tr '\n' ' ' < $g | tr -s ' ' | grep -oF -f $T/gone; done | grep -c .) fill=$([ "$(diff factory/prompts/$f.md docs/prompts/$c | grep '^[<>]')" = "$(diff $T/a $T/b | grep '^[<>]')" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `spec_writer copy=SAME doc=4/4 run=4/4 gone=0 fill=unchanged`, then `critic copy=SAME doc=8/8 run=8/8 gone=0 fill=unchanged`. `doc` and `run` count the kept or added phrases found in the documented copy and the run copy, each joined into one line so a phrase may wrap; `gone` counts the removed phrases found in either.

### Requirement: Spec writer and critic runs receive the turn-economy rules
The system prompt that `run start` writes for a spec writer run SHALL contain the writer's turn-economy rule. The one it writes for a critic run SHALL contain the critic's reading rules, its no-suite rule and the sentence allowing a small scratch experiment, and MUST NOT contain the per-claim cap or the no-build rule.

#### Scenario: A critic run's prompt has the no-suite rule and the scratch allowance, and no cap or build ban
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s; for i in 1 2; do printf "# F$i\n\nDo x.\n" > $T/req$i.md; bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req$i.md >/dev/null; done; bin/factory ticket set T-0001 status=ready-for-spec-writer >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0002 status=ready-for-critic >/dev/null; bin/factory run start --role spec_writer --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1; bin/factory run start --role critic --ticket T-0002 >/dev/null 2>&1; W=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $FACTORY_STATE/runs/run-0001-spec_writer/system-prompt.txt | tr -s ' '); C=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $FACTORY_STATE/runs/run-0002-critic/system-prompt.txt | tr -s ' '); echo "spec_writer batch=$(printf "%s" "$W" | grep -c 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn') writes=$(printf "%s" "$W" | grep -c 'Write the spec in as few writes as you can')"; echo "critic batch=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn') suite=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Run no test suite') scratch=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'small experiment in your scratch directory') cap=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Ground any one claim') build=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'build nothing')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `spec_writer batch=1 writes=1`, then `critic batch=1 suite=1 scratch=1 cap=0 build=0`

### Requirement: Nothing else in the two prompts changes
The spec writer prompt copies SHALL stay as #73 left them at `05cf8f9`. In the critic prompt copies, everything before the PROCESS section and everything from ANTI-GOODHARTING on SHALL stay byte for byte as on `main`. No other file under `docs/prompts/`, `factory/prompts/` or `agents/` SHALL change.

#### Scenario: The writer prompt is as #73 left it, and only the critic's PROCESS changes
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); n=0; for x in "docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md|1,/^PROCESS\$/p" "docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md|/^ANTI-GOODHARTING/,\$p" "factory/prompts/critic.md|1,/^PROCESS\$/p" "factory/prompts/critic.md|/^ANTI-GOODHARTING/,\$p"; do f=${x%%|*}; s=${x#*|}; git show main:$f | sed -n "$s" > $T/a; sed -n "$s" $f > $T/b; [ -s $T/a ] || n=$((n+100)); cmp -s $T/a $T/b || { n=$((n+1)); echo "changed: $f $s"; }; done; echo "sections_changed=$n writer=$(git diff --name-only 05cf8f9 HEAD -- docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md factory/prompts/spec_writer.md | grep -c .) others=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts agents | grep -vxF -e docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md -e factory/prompts/critic.md | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints only `sections_changed=0 writer=0 others=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the turn-economy change
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #73, numbered without a gap. `docs/principles.md` principle 2 SHALL name the critic's no-suite rule among its mechanisms, SHALL no longer say the critic builds nothing, and SHALL say part B.2 is done by #41 for the code reviewer and by #73 for the critic.

#### Scenario: Principle 2 names the critic's no-suite rule and no longer its build ban
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; P=$(sed -n '/^### 2\. /,/^### 3\. /p' docs/principles.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "entries73=$(grep -c '^[0-9]*\. After issue #73 ' docs/changelog.md) implemented=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'runs no test suite (#73') builds=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'builds nothing') status=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'done by #41 for the code reviewer and by #73 for the critic')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `CONTIGUOUS`, then `entries73=1 implemented=1 builds=0 status=1`

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The documents record the critic revert
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for issue #74 as its last numbered entry, numbered without a gap, that records the replay result and the two removed rules. The Spiking section of `docs/principles.md` SHALL no longer bound the critic to two paths and one command or say it does not build, SHALL say the critic may run a small scratch check, SHALL say vetting a whole approach belongs to the spec writer or a spike, and SHALL record the replay. The change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the revert as its last entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -oF -e '#74' -e replay -e 'per-claim cap' -e 'no-build rule' -e 'no test suite' -e UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR -e brace-list | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `7`

#### Scenario: The Spiking section allows a small scratch check and records the replay
- WHEN `(X=$(sed -n '/^## Spiking/,$p' docs/principles.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "bound=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'two paths, one command') nobuild=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'it does not build') scratch=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'small scratch check') whole=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'vetting a whole approach belongs to the spec writer') replay=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'replay')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `bound=0 nobuild=0 scratch=1 whole=1 replay=1`

#### Scenario: The critic revert adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`
