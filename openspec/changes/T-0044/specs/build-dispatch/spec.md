## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A role run does not start on a ticket that already has a run in flight
`factory run start` for triage, spec_writer, critic, planner or implementer SHALL refuse, with exit 2 and nothing written, when the ticket already has a run in flight. The error MUST read `<ticket id> already has run <first in-flight run id> in flight`.

#### Scenario: A second intake run on a ticket is refused with the same text
The second start carries `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1`, the marker that lets a command past the live-store fence, so the command reaches the run-start check rather than the fence.
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md && $B ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null && $B run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null && FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 $B run start --role triage --ticket T-0001 2>&1 >/dev/null; echo "exit=$?"; ls $T/tgt/.factory/state/runs)`
- THEN it prints `T-0001 already has run run-0001-triage in flight`, then `exit=2`, then `run-0001-triage` as the only run directory
