# build-dispatch

## Requirements

### Requirement: A park reason carries the failing command's error
When a store command fails and its relayed stderr is empty, the workflow scripts MUST put the refusal's JSON `error`, or else the exit code, after the reason's prefix, so that no park reason ends blank.

#### Scenario: A refused archive or sub-ticket add parks with the refusal text
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify"}}, "ticket parent-check": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify", "reuse": "run-0001-verifier"}}, "archive": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "no spec store (factory init not run)"}, "exit": 2}}'; node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-planner"}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "PLANNED"}}, "subticket add": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "ST-2: no Depends on line"}, "exit": 2}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `park: archive: no spec store (factory init not run)`, then `start: planner`, then `park: harness-bug: subticket add: ST-2: no Depends on line`

#### Scenario: A refused run start during intake parks with the refusal text
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/intake.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-triage", "round": {"spec": 0}}}, "run start": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "T-0001 is parked, not ready-for-triage"}, "exit": 2}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: triage`, then `park: harness-bug: run start triage: T-0001 is parked, not ready-for-triage`

#### Scenario: A command that prints no JSON parks with its exit code
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify"}}, "ticket parent-check": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-parent-verify", "reuse": "run-0001-verifier"}}, "archive": {"raw": "", "exit": 1}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `park: archive: exit 1, no JSON on stdout`

### Requirement: The build runs only the checkers a commit still needs
When a sub-ticket reaches the checks without an implementer run in that pass, the build MUST run only the checkers that have no result row on its commit; after an implementer run it SHALL run both.

#### Scenario: A redispatched sub-ticket runs only the checker whose row was set aside
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show T-0001 ": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "planned"}}, "ticket ready-implementers": [{"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": ["T-0001.1"], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}, {"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}], "ticket show T-0001.1": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "checks-in-flight"}}, "ticket head": {"out": {"ok": true, "head": "abababababababababababababababababababab"}}, "results show": {"out": {"ok": true, "rows": {"verifier": "VERIFIED", "ci": "PASS"}, "missing": ["reviewer"]}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "APPROVE"}}, "ticket join": {"out": {"ok": true, "decision": "park", "reason": "stub stop"}}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: reviewer`, then `park: stub stop`

#### Scenario: After an implementer run both checkers run
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show T-0001 ": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "planned"}}, "ticket ready-implementers": [{"out": {"ok": true, "ready": ["T-0001.1"], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}, {"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}], "ticket show T-0001.1": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-implementer"}}, "ticket head": {"out": {"ok": true, "head": "abababababababababababababababababababab"}}, "results show": {"out": {"ok": true, "rows": {"reviewer": "REQUEST-CHANGES", "verifier": "VERIFIED", "ci": "PASS"}, "missing": []}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "READY-FOR-REVIEW"}}, "ticket join": {"out": {"ok": true, "decision": "park", "reason": "stub stop"}}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: implementer`, `start: reviewer`, `start: verifier`, `park: stub stop`, one per line

### Requirement: The workflows' clerk commands carry the dispatcher marker
Every store command that `factory/workflows/intake.js` and `factory/workflows/build.js` send to the clerk MUST carry `FACTORY_DISPATCH=1` in its environment assignments, so that a dispatch SHALL still complete on a live store while its own role run is in flight.

#### Scenario: Every clerk command of both workflows carries the marker
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once.
- WHEN `(echo "intake: $(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-count.mjs factory/workflows/intake.js)"; echo "build: $(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-count.mjs factory/workflows/build.js)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `intake: sent unmarked=0`, then `build: sent unmarked=0`

#### Scenario: An intake run against a real store reaches its end with its run in flight
Needs the GIVEN block of "Unmarked writes from inside the target are refused while a run is in flight, init included" run once. The clerk commands run for real on a scratch instance's own store, from the checkout under test, and the triage run is in flight when the workflow records its result.
- WHEN `(T=$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P); B=$PWD/bin/factory; git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && (cd $T/tgt && $B init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && printf '# F\n\nDo x.\n' > $T/req.md && $B ticket new --file $T/req.md >/dev/null) && echo "returned=$(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0024-e2e.mjs $T/tgt/.factory) stored=$(cd $T/tgt && $B ticket show T-0001 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `returned=closed stored=closed`

### Requirement: An implementer starts only when each sibling-added test it may change came from a merged sibling
`factory run start --role implementer` on a sub-ticket MUST refuse with exit 2, writing no run, worktree, branch or in-flight entry, with an error that starts `BLOCKED from harness: ` and names the file, when a line `` `<file>` (added by <ID>) `` inside its "Tests to change" field names a file that existed at the parent's base, or whose first adding commit on the integration branch since that base lies inside no merged sibling's recorded merge. It SHALL accept a file a merged sibling's merge added, and SHALL ignore such a line outside that field.

#### Scenario: A test file a merged sibling added may be listed, and a mention outside Tests to change is ignored
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `git` and `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the two fixture files written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names them reuses them)

- THEN it prints exactly `exit=0 ready-for-implementer runs=1`

#### Scenario: A listed test that predates the plan, came from no sibling's merge, or was never added is refused before the implementer starts
Needs the GIVEN block of "A test file a merged sibling added may be listed, and a mention outside Tests to change is ignored" run once.
- WHEN `(for E in tests/test_old.py tests/test_operator.py tests/test_never.py; do (. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-sib.sh && bin/factory run start --role implementer --ticket T-0001.2 >$T22/o 2>/dev/null; x=$?; J=$(tail -1 $T22/o); echo "exit=$x blocked=$(echo "$J" | grep -c '"error": "BLOCKED from harness: ') names=$(echo "$J" | grep -cF "$E") runs=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs 2>/dev/null | grep -c .) branch=$(git -C $FACTORY_REPO branch --list 'factory/T-0001.2' | grep -c .) $(bin/factory ticket show T-0001.2 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')"); done)`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `exit=2 blocked=1 names=1 runs=0 branch=0 ready-for-implementer`

### Requirement: The build parks a harness-blocked sub-ticket as BLOCKED, so a ruling returns it
When an implementer's run start is refused with an error that starts `BLOCKED `, the build workflow SHALL park the sub-ticket with that error, verbatim, as the reason, so that `factory resolve <id> --ruling F` MUST accept the park and return the sub-ticket to `ready-for-implementer`.

#### Scenario: The build parks the blocked sub-ticket with the harness's reason, and a ruling sends it back
Needs the GIVEN block of "A test file a merged sibling added may be listed, and a mention outside Tests to change is ignored" run once.
- WHEN `(E=tests/test_old.py; . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-sib.sh && node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-build.mjs | sed 's/\(BLOCKED from harness:\).*/\1/'; printf 'Ruling: x\n' > $T22/r.md; bin/factory resolve T-0001.2 --ruling $T22/r.md >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "ruling=$? $(bin/factory ticket show T-0001.2 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `park T-0001.2: BLOCKED from harness:`, then `ruling=0 ready-for-implementer`

### Requirement: The build asks the whole-spec step before it runs the planner
At `ready-for-planner`, `factory/workflows/build.js` MUST first run `plan whole-spec`. On `"planner": "skipped"` it SHALL move the parent to `planned` and build the sub-ticket with no planner run. On any other success it SHALL run the planner as before. On a refusal it MUST park the parent with `harness-bug: plan whole-spec: <error>`.

#### Scenario: A qualifying spec reaches its implementer with no planner run, and a refused whole-spec step parks with its error
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show T-0001 ": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-planner"}}, "plan whole-spec": {"out": {"ok": true, "planner": "skipped", "reason": "fixture", "subtickets": [{"id": "T-0001.1"}]}}, "ticket ready-implementers": [{"out": {"ok": true, "ready": ["T-0001.1"], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}, {"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}], "ticket show T-0001.1": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-implementer"}}, "ticket head": {"out": {"ok": true, "head": "abababababababababababababababababababab"}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "READY-FOR-REVIEW"}}, "ticket join": {"out": {"ok": true, "decision": "park", "reason": "stub stop"}}}'; node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-planner"}}, "plan whole-spec": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "T-0001 has no approved spec"}, "exit": 2}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: implementer`, `start: reviewer`, `start: verifier`, `park: stub stop`, `park: harness-bug: plan whole-spec: T-0001 has no approved spec`, one per line

#### Scenario: A spec that needs the planner still gets a planner run
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-planner"}}, "plan whole-spec": {"out": {"ok": true, "planner": "needed", "reason": "the spec writer marked it NEEDS-SPLIT"}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "status": "PLANNED"}}, "subticket add": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "stub stop"}, "exit": 2}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: planner`, then `park: harness-bug: subticket add: stub stop`

### Requirement: A role run that leaves no output is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT
When a role run ends without an output file, or with a blank one, whatever the agent call returned, `run finish` MUST record it as `EMPTY-OUTPUT` and never as `KILLED`. The workflow MUST keep the agent's non-blank last message as that run's `last-message.md` and re-dispatch the same role once. A second `EMPTY-OUTPUT` in a row SHALL park the ticket as `EMPTY-OUTPUT from <role>`, with no result row for that run.

#### Scenario: A reviewer that ends its turn waiting on its own commands is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT beside the verifier's passing rows
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `git` and `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell. This scenario needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- GIVEN the two fixture files written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names them reuses them)

#### Scenario: One empty reviewer run followed by a real one routes on the real one
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "A reviewer that ends its turn waiting on its own commands is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT beside the verifier's passing rows" run once. The first reviewer call returns `null`; the verifier's SPEC-DEFECT gives the join a fixed stop.

- THEN it prints exactly `park T-0001.2: EMPTY-OUTPUT from implementer`, then `implementer: EMPTY-OUTPUT EMPTY-OUTPUT `

#### Scenario: An intake role's second empty output in a row parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT

- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/intake.js '{"ticket show": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "ready-for-triage", "round": {"spec": 0}}}, "run finish": {"out": {"ok": true, "run_id": "run-0009-x", "status": "EMPTY-OUTPUT", "escalations": []}}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `start: triage`, then `start: triage`, then `park: EMPTY-OUTPUT from triage`

### Requirement: A role run that writes its output runs once and routes on its STATUS
A role run whose output file holds a STATUS MUST NOT be re-dispatched, and the build SHALL route on that STATUS as before.

#### Scenario: A reviewer that writes its output runs once
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "A reviewer that ends its turn waiting on its own commands is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT beside the verifier's passing rows" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-checks.sh && node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-build.mjs '{"reviewer": [{"write": "APPROVE"}], "verifier": [{"write": "SPEC-DEFECT"}]}'; echo "reviewer: $(for d in $(ls -d $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-reviewer); do sed -n 's/^status: //p' $d/meta.yaml; done | tr '\n' ' ')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `park T-0001.1: SPEC-DEFECT from verifier`, then `reviewer: APPROVE `

### Requirement: The build counts only the current plan's sub-tickets
The build MUST NOT park a parent for a superseded sub-ticket the human closed, and SHALL dispatch the current plan's ready sub-tickets. A closed sub-ticket of the current plan MUST still park the parent with `sub-ticket closed by a human: <id>`.

#### Scenario: The build of a re-planned parent dispatches the new sub-ticket instead of parking on the old one
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A test file a merged sibling added may be listed, and a mention outside Tests to change is ignored", "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "After a re-spec and a re-plan, only the new plan's sub-tickets count and the old records are kept" run once. In `t0022-build.mjs` every role run returns an empty string, so the implementer of the dispatched sub-ticket ends EMPTY-OUTPUT twice.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0038-respec.sh && printf 'ST-1 / Redo\nDepends on: T-0001.1\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan2.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan2.md >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to planned --by t >/dev/null; node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-build.mjs)`
- THEN it prints exactly `park T-0001.4: EMPTY-OUTPUT from implementer`

#### Scenario: A sub-ticket of the current plan that a human closed still parks the parent
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A test file a merged sibling added may be listed, and a mention outside Tests to change is ignored" and "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && printf 'ST-1 / First\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n\nST-2 / Second\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan1.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan1.md >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to planned --by t >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket transition T-0001.2 --to closed --by t >/dev/null; node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-build.mjs)`
- THEN it prints exactly `park T-0001: sub-ticket closed by a human: T-0001.2`

### Requirement: A parent's final check and close count only the current plan's sub-tickets
`factory ticket parent-check` SHALL move a planned parent to `ready-for-parent-verify` when every current sub-ticket has merged, and `ticket transition <parent> --to closed` MUST accept a VERIFIED final check whatever its superseded sub-tickets' states.

#### Scenario: With the new plan merged, the re-planned parent reaches its final check and closes
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "After a re-spec and a re-plan, only the new plan's sub-tickets count and the old records are kept" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0038-respec.sh && printf 'ST-1 / Redo\nDepends on: T-0001.1\nParallel-safe: yes\n' > $T23/plan2.md && bin/factory subticket add T-0001 --file $T23/plan2.md >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to planned --by t >/dev/null && bin/factory ticket set T-0001.4 status=merged >/dev/null; echo "check: $(bin/factory ticket parent-check T-0001 | tail -1 | grep -o '"state": "[^"]*"')"; R=$(bin/factory run start --role verifier --ticket T-0001 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'); if [ -n "$R" ]; then H=$(sed -n "s/^head: '*\([0-9a-f]*\).*/\1/p" $FACTORY_STATE/runs/$R/meta.yaml); printf "Commit: $H\nGate suite: PASS\nSTATUS: VERIFIED\nCONFIDENCE: high, fixture\nESCALATIONS: none\n" > $FACTORY_STATE/runs/$R/output.md; bin/factory run finish $R >/dev/null 2>&1; fi; bin/factory ticket transition T-0001 --to closed --by t >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "close=$? $(bin/factory ticket show T-0001 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `check: "state": "ready-for-parent-verify"`, then `close=0 closed`

### Requirement: The build parks a merge the gate blocked, with the gate's reason
When `factory merge` is refused with an error that starts `BLOCKED `, `factory/workflows/build.js` MUST park the sub-ticket with that error, verbatim, as the reason, and SHALL NOT record it as a harness bug.

#### Scenario: The build parks a merge refused for protected paths with the gate's reason
Needs the GIVEN block of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" (current truth, human-resolution) run once.
- WHEN `(node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-wf.mjs factory/workflows/build.js '{"ticket show T-0001 ": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "planned"}}, "ticket ready-implementers": [{"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": ["T-0001.1"], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}, {"out": {"ok": true, "ready": [], "resumable": [], "remaining": ["T-0001.1"], "subtickets": ["T-0001.1"], "closed": []}}], "ticket show T-0001.1": {"out": {"ok": true, "state": "checks-in-flight"}}, "ticket head": {"out": {"ok": true, "head": "abababababababababababababababababababab"}}, "results show": {"out": {"ok": true, "rows": {"reviewer": "APPROVE", "verifier": "VERIFIED", "ci": "PASS"}, "missing": []}}, "ticket join": {"out": {"ok": true, "decision": "merge", "reason": "ci PASS + APPROVE + VERIFIED on the current head"}}, "merge": {"out": {"ok": false, "error": "BLOCKED from merge gate: protected paths not declared in T-0001 spec v1: core/b.py"}, "exit": 2}}')`
- THEN it prints exactly `park: BLOCKED from merge gate: protected paths not declared in T-0001 spec v1: core/b.py`

### Requirement: A sub-ticket whose spec drifted parks before its first implementer run
`factory run start --role implementer` on a sub-ticket with no implementer run and no ruling on file MUST refuse with exit 2, writing no run, with an error that starts `BLOCKED from harness: spec drift: `, when its Acceptance field names a sibling of the current plan that has not merged and is not among its dependencies, or when a test file changed on the integration branch since the parent's approved version was written, in a commit that changed a file that version's design names, and no Tests to change list names it; the build SHALL park it with that error, and a ruling SHALL let the next run start.

#### Scenario: A sub-ticket whose Acceptance names an unmerged sibling it does not depend on is refused until that sibling merges
Needs the GIVEN block of "An intent-unchanged amendment re-pins the change and keeps the plan's tasks" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0027-amend.sh && plan 'ST-1 / First\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n\nST-2 / Second\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\nAcceptance:\n- REGRESSION: ST-1 scenarios still pass\n' && J=$(bin/factory run start --role implementer --ticket T-0001.2 2>/dev/null | tail -1); echo "unmerged: blocked=$(echo "$J" | grep -c '"error": "BLOCKED from harness: spec drift: ') names=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'T-0001.1') runs=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs 2>/dev/null | grep -c .) $(bin/factory ticket show T-0001.2 | sed -n 's/^status: //p')"; bin/factory ticket set T-0001.1 status=merged >/dev/null; bin/factory run start --role implementer --ticket T-0001.2 >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "merged: exit=$? runs=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs | grep -c implementer)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `unmerged: blocked=1 names=1 runs=0 ready-for-implementer`, then `merged: exit=0 runs=1`

#### Scenario: A test changed beside a file the spec names parks the sub-ticket, and a ruling lets it start
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "An intent-unchanged amendment re-pins the change and keeps the plan's tasks" and of "A test file a merged sibling added may be listed, and a mention outside Tests to change is ignored" (current truth, build-dispatch) run once. In `t0022-build.mjs` every role run returns an empty string.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0027-amend.sh && plan 'ST-1 / First\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes\n' && land src/greet.py tests/test_greet.py && land src/other.py tests/test_other.py && node ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-build.mjs | sed 's/\(spec drift:\).*/\1/'; R=$(bin/factory ticket show T-0001.1 --json | tail -1); echo "greet=$(echo "$R" | grep -c 'tests/test_greet.py') other=$(echo "$R" | grep -c 'tests/test_other.py') runs=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs 2>/dev/null | grep -c implementer)"; printf 'Ruling: the new test may change.\n' > $T27/r.md; bin/factory resolve T-0001.1 --ruling $T27/r.md >/dev/null 2>&1; bin/factory run start --role implementer --ticket T-0001.1 >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "ruled: exit=$? runs=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs | grep -c implementer)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `park T-0001.1: BLOCKED from harness: spec drift:`, then `greet=1 other=0 runs=0`, then `ruled: exit=0 runs=1`

### Requirement: Changes that leave a sub-ticket's spec intact do not park it
A sub-ticket's first implementer run SHALL start when the commits since its parent's approved version was written change no file that version's design names, when every test they change is listed under Tests to change, or when an amendment was written after them.

#### Scenario: Unrelated changes, a listed test and an amendment written after the change let the implementer start
Needs the GIVEN block of "An intent-unchanged amendment re-pins the change and keeps the plan's tasks" run once.
- WHEN `(for c in other listed amended; do (. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0027-amend.sh && T='\nTests to change: none\n'; [ $c = listed ] && T='\nTests to change:\n- \140tests/test_greet.py\140: pins the old greeting\n'; plan "ST-1 / First\nDepends on: none\nParallel-safe: yes$T" && if [ $c = other ]; then land src/other.py tests/test_other.py; else land src/greet.py tests/test_greet.py; fi && if [ $c = amended ]; then bin/factory spec amend T-0001 --file $T27/v2.md --reason "Seed the greeting." --intent unchanged >/dev/null 2>&1; fi; bin/factory run start --role implementer --ticket T-0001.1 >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "$c: exit=$? runs=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs 2>/dev/null | grep -c implementer)"); done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `other: exit=0 runs=1`, then `listed: exit=0 runs=1`, then `amended: exit=0 runs=1`
