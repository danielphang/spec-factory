# harness-docs

## Requirements

### Requirement: The documents record the change
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain entry 51 covering every part, numbered without a gap, `README.md` SHALL describe the new `resolve` behaviour and relative environment paths, and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the change in order
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print n, (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; sed -n '/^51\. /p' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e BLOCKED -e '--replan' -e 'next free' -e 'error text' -e redispatch -e '-whitespace' -e context.md -e relative -e uncommitted | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `51 CONTIGUOUS`, then `9`

#### Scenario: The README describes the new resolve verbs
- WHEN `(echo "replan=$(grep -c -- '--replan' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') gap=$(grep -c 'has no .resolve. verb' README.md)")`
- THEN it prints `replan=1 gap=0`

#### Scenario: The README says relative paths resolve from the caller's directory
- WHEN `(grep -c 'relative .FACTORY_' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')`
- THEN it prints `1`

#### Scenario: The change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the live-store guard
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for this change as its last numbered entry, numbered without a gap; `docs/design.md` SHALL describe the dispatcher marker and the run-directory rule; README's "Where a human decides" SHALL open with the marker's exact command form and say that the refusal deliberately does not name it; README SHALL say the final verifier run is listed as in flight and SHALL no longer say the factory's capabilities never entered the spec store; no prompt copy under `docs/prompts/` or `factory/prompts/` SHALL change; and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the guard as its last entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -oF -e FACTORY_DISPATCH -e 'in flight' -e throwaway -e 'exit 2' -e 'worktrees/' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: The design doc names the marker and the run-directory rule, and no prompt copy changes
- WHEN `(echo "design=$(grep -c FACTORY_DISPATCH docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') dirs=$(grep FACTORY_DISPATCH docs/design.md | grep -c 'worktrees/' | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') prompts=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design=1 dirs=1 prompts=0`

#### Scenario: README tells the operator how to write during a run, first thing under Where a human decides
- WHEN `(H=$(sed -n '/^## Where a human decides/,/^## What is built/p' README.md); J=$(echo "$H" | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "first=$(echo "$H" | sed -n '3p' | grep -c 'FACTORY_DISPATCH=1') command=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'FACTORY_DISPATCH=1 [^ ]*bin/factory ') unnamed=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'deliberately does not name the marker') export=$(echo "$J" | grep -ci 'never export') rundirs=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'worktrees/')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `first=1 command=1 unnamed=1 export=1 rundirs=1`

#### Scenario: README says the final verifier run is listed as in flight
- WHEN `(R=$(tr '\n' ' ' < README.md | tr -s ' '); echo "stale=$(echo "$R" | grep -o 'does not list it as in flight' | grep -c .) listed=$(echo "$R" | grep -o 'lists it as in flight' | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `stale=0 listed=1`

#### Scenario: README no longer says the factory's capabilities never entered the spec store
- WHEN `(echo "bullet=$(grep -c 'Current truth for the factory itself' README.md) stale=$(grep -c 'never entered it' README.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `bullet=1 stale=0`

#### Scenario: The guard change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents describe the store branch
The design doc SHALL name the store branch `factory-store` and the never-tracked path rule, and the build spec SHALL call the store branch only `factory-store`. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one contiguously numbered entry recording the change. `README.md` SHALL describe committing the store on its branch, `factory store migrate`, the `git clean -ffdx` hazard and a checkout from before the move, and SHALL no longer say that a store commit moves the integration branch or give `.factory/state/` as the live store's location. The change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design doc names the store branch and the path rule
- WHEN `(Q=$(printf '\140'); echo "store_branch=$(grep -c 'factory-store' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') tickets_branch=$(grep -c "${Q}tickets${Q} branch" docs/design.md) never_tracked=$(grep -c 'never tracked' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints `store_branch=1 tickets_branch=0 never_tracked=1`

#### Scenario: The build spec calls the store branch factory-store
- WHEN `(Q=$(printf '\140'); echo "old_name=$(grep -c "${Q}tickets${Q}\|refs/heads/tickets\|HEAD:tickets" dev/build-harness.spec.md) new_name=$(grep -c 'factory-store' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints `old_name=0 new_name=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records the store branch in one contiguous entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep -E '^[0-9]+\. ' docs/changelog.md | grep 'factory-store' | grep -c 'never tracked')`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`

#### Scenario: The README describes the store branch and the move
`old_cost` joins the page into one line first, because the retired clause is wrapped across two lines. `old_refs` counts only the places that give the live store's location, so a how-to may still name the path a store moves from.
- WHEN `(Q=$(printf '\140'); echo "store_branch=$(grep -c 'factory-store' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') migrate=$(grep -c 'factory store migrate' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') ffdx=$(grep -c -- '-ffdx' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') premove=$(grep -c 'from before the move' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') old_cost=$(tr '\n' ' ' < README.md | grep -c 'committing the store to the same branch') old_refs=$(grep -c "\.factory/state/\(log\|tickets\)\|(${Q}\.factory/state/${Q})\|at ${Q}\.factory/state/${Q}" README.md)")`
- THEN it prints `store_branch=1 migrate=1 ffdx=1 premove=1 old_cost=0 old_refs=0`

#### Scenario: The store-branch change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The planner labels checks per sub-ticket and may list tests an earlier sibling added
Every copy of the planner prompt (the `docs/design.md` §4 block, `docs/prompts/04-planner.md`, `factory/prompts/planner.md`) SHALL tell the planner to label each check against the sub-ticket's own base, to name interim tests, and to list a sibling-added test as `` `<file>[::<test>]` (added by <sibling ID>): <reason> ``; it MUST no longer say to label checks "the same way", and the design block and its `docs/prompts/` copy SHALL stay byte-identical.

#### Scenario: Every planner copy labels per sub-ticket and lists sibling tests
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-planner.txt; sed -n '/^## 4\. Planner/,/^## 5\. /p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/04-planner.md factory/prompts/planner.md; do echo "own=$(grep -c "against this sub-ticket's own base" $f) sibling=$(grep -cF '(added by <sibling ID>)' $f) interim=$(grep -c '^  Interim tests: ' $f) copied=$(grep -c 'labelled NEW or REGRESSION the same way' $f)"; done; cmp -s $X docs/prompts/04-planner.md && echo verbatim || echo differs)`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `own=1 sibling=1 interim=1 copied=0`, then `verbatim`

### Requirement: The spec writer lists the tests a decision overturns, and the critic checks for one left off
Every copy of the spec writer prompt SHALL carry the RULES bullet that starts `- Tests a decision overturns: `, and every copy of the critic prompt SHALL say under rubric 1 that a test pinning the old behaviour and `missing from "Tests to change" is a finding`.

#### Scenario: Every spec writer and critic copy carries the decision-overturns rule
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-sw.txt; for h in '2\. Spec writer' '3\. Spec critic'; do sed -n "/^## $h/,/^## [0-9]/p" docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p"; done > $X; echo "design: writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' $X) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' $X)"; echo "docs/prompts: writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md)"; echo "factory/prompts: writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' factory/prompts/spec_writer.md) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' factory/prompts/critic.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design: writer=1 critic=1`, then `docs/prompts: writer=1 critic=1`, then `factory/prompts: writer=1 critic=1`

### Requirement: The preamble and the code reviewer accept a checked sibling entry
Every copy of the preamble SHALL allow an existing test listed `in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling`, and every copy of the code reviewer prompt SHALL not block a test `the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling`.

#### Scenario: Every preamble and reviewer copy accepts a sibling entry
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0022-pr.txt; for h in 'Shared preamble' '6\. Code reviewer'; do sed -n "/^## $h/,/^## [0-9A-Z]/p" docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p"; done > $X; echo "design: guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' $X) review=$(grep -c 'or the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling' $X)"; echo "docs/prompts: guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' docs/prompts/00-preamble.md) review=$(grep -c 'or the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling' docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md)"; echo "factory/prompts: guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' factory/prompts/preamble.md) review=$(grep -c 'or the sub-ticket lists it there as added by an earlier sibling' factory/prompts/reviewer.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design: guard=1 review=1`, then `docs/prompts: guard=1 review=1`, then `factory/prompts: guard=1 review=1`

### Requirement: Role runs receive the new rules
The system prompt that `run start` writes for a planner, spec writer and critic run SHALL contain that role's new rule and the new preamble sentence.

#### Scenario: Planner, spec writer and critic runs get the new rules in their system prompts
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s; for i in 1 2 3; do printf "# F$i\n\nDo x.\n" > $T/req$i.md; bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req$i.md >/dev/null; done; bin/factory ticket set T-0001 status=ready-for-planner >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0002 status=ready-for-spec-writer >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0003 status=ready-for-critic >/dev/null; for p in planner:T-0001 spec_writer:T-0002 critic:T-0003; do bin/factory run start --role ${p%%:*} --ticket ${p##*:} >/dev/null 2>&1; done; P=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-planner/system-prompt.txt); W=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-spec_writer/system-prompt.txt); C=$(ls $FACTORY_STATE/runs/*-critic/system-prompt.txt); echo "planner own=$(grep -c "against this sub-ticket's own base" $P) sibling=$(grep -cF '(added by <sibling ID>)' $P) guard=$(grep -c '^in your sub-ticket as added by an earlier sibling' $P) writer=$(grep -c '^- Tests a decision overturns: ' $W) critic=$(grep -c 'from "Tests to change" is a finding' $C)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `planner own=1 sibling=1 guard=1 writer=1 critic=1`

### Requirement: The documents record the sibling-tests check
`docs/design.md` SHALL describe the check in a paragraph that starts `**Tests a sibling added.**`, in piece 8 and in the spec approval gate row, and SHALL no longer call the gate's list the only authorization to alter an existing test; `dev/build-harness.spec.md` SHALL name the `BLOCKED from harness` refusal; `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain an entry for issue #40 and stay numbered without a gap; `README.md` SHALL describe the check and the new `--ruling` case; and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design doc and build spec describe the check
- WHEN `(echo "piece8=$(grep '^| 8 |' docs/design.md | grep -c 'added by that sibling') gate=$(grep '^| Spec approval |' docs/design.md | grep -c 'a test an earlier sibling added') stale=$(grep -c 'which is the only authorization to alter an existing test' docs/design.md) check=$(grep -c '^\*\*Tests a sibling added\.\*\*.*BLOCKED from harness:' docs/design.md) build=$(grep -c 'BLOCKED from harness' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `piece8=1 gate=1 stale=0 check=1 build=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records issue 40's change without a numbering gap
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #40 ' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e 'own base' -e 'added by' -e 'BLOCKED from harness' -e 'Decision' -e 'critic rubric 1' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: README describes the sibling tests check and its ruling
- WHEN `(echo "built=$(grep -c '^- \*\*Sibling tests check\.\*\*' README.md) ruling=$(grep '^| \*\*Unstick\*\*' README.md | grep -c 'a test no merged sibling added')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `built=1 ruling=1`

#### Scenario: The sibling-tests change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the declared-path rule
The "## 5. Implementer" and "## 7. Verifier" blocks of `docs/design.md` SHALL carry the declared-path rule and stay verbatim copies of `docs/prompts/05-implementer.md` and `docs/prompts/07-verifier.md`. The run copies under `factory/prompts/` SHALL differ from those files only by the fills they had on `main`. The code reviewer and preamble copies MUST NOT change. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for issue #49, numbered without a gap, and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design blocks and their copies carry the rule and stay in step
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); Q=$(printf '\140\140\140'); for r in "5. Implementer|05-implementer.md|implementer" "7. Verifier|07-verifier.md|verifier"; do h=${r%%|*}; x=${r#*|}; c=${x%%|*}; f=${x#*|}; git show main:factory/prompts/$f.md > $T/a; git show main:docs/prompts/$c > $T/b; echo "$f copy=$(awk -v h="## $h" -v q="$Q" '$0==h{s=1;next} s&&$0==q"text"{p=1;next} p&&$0==q{exit} p' docs/design.md | cmp -s - docs/prompts/$c && echo SAME || echo DIFF) rule=$(tr '\n' ' ' < docs/prompts/$c | tr -s ' ' | grep -c 'A protected path the sub-ticket declares is not an escalation') fill=$([ "$(diff factory/prompts/$f.md docs/prompts/$c | grep '^[<>]')" = "$(diff $T/a $T/b | grep '^[<>]')" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer copy=SAME rule=1 fill=unchanged`, then `verifier copy=SAME rule=1 fill=unchanged`. `copy=SAME`: the design block equals its `docs/prompts/` file. `rule=1`: that file carries the rule. `fill=unchanged`: the run copy under `factory/prompts/` differs from the documented copy only where it did on `main`.

#### Scenario: The code reviewer and preamble copies do not change
- WHEN `(echo "changed=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- factory/prompts/reviewer.md factory/prompts/preamble.md docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md docs/prompts/00-preamble.md | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `changed=0`

#### Scenario: The changelog records the declared-path rule in a contiguous entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep -E '^[0-9]+\. ' docs/changelog.md | grep -F '#49' | grep -c 'ESCALATIONS')`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `1`

#### Scenario: The declared-path change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the small-change lane
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for this change as its last numbered entry, numbered without a gap. `docs/design.md`, `dev/build-harness.spec.md` and `README.md` SHALL describe the whole-spec sub-ticket and gate-command paths. No prompt copy SHALL change, and the change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the small-change lane as its last entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -oF -e 'paths' -e SKIPPED -e 'plan whole-spec' -e NEEDS-SPLIT -e seams | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: The design doc, build spec and README describe both skips, and no prompt copy changes
- WHEN `(echo "design=$(grep -c 'whole-spec' docs/design.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') gate=$(grep '^| 11 | Gate runner' docs/design.md | grep -c 'SKIPPED') build=$(grep -c 'plan whole-spec' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') readme=$(grep -c 'plan whole-spec' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') skipped=$(grep -c 'SKIPPED' README.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') stale=$(grep -c 'The build workflow runs the planner, which' README.md) prompts=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts agents | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `design=1 gate=1 build=1 readme=1 skipped=1 stale=0 prompts=0`

#### Scenario: The small-change lane adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: Every role is told to wait for its own commands
Every copy of the shared preamble SHALL carry the bullet that starts `- Run every command in the foreground and wait for it to finish.` and says `Never end your turn while a command you started is still running`. The design block and both files MUST stay byte-identical, and every role run's system prompt SHALL carry the bullet.

#### Scenario: Every preamble copy carries the wait rule and the copies stay identical
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-pre.txt; sed -n '/^## Shared preamble/,/^## [0-9]/p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/00-preamble.md factory/prompts/preamble.md; do echo "fg=$(grep -c '^- Run every command in the foreground and wait for it to finish\.$' $f) end=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $f | tr -s ' ' | grep -c 'Never end your turn while a command you started is still running')"; done; cmp -s $X docs/prompts/00-preamble.md && cmp -s docs/prompts/00-preamble.md factory/prompts/preamble.md && echo verbatim || echo differs)`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `fg=1 end=1`, then `verbatim`

#### Scenario: Implementer, reviewer and verifier run prompts carry the wait rule, and only the reviewer's carries the judge-the-diff rule
Needs the GIVEN block of "Implementer and verifier run prompts carry the declared-path rule" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0029-prompt.sh && for r in implementer reviewer verifier; do P=$(prompt $r); echo "$r fg=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'Never end your turn while a command you started is still running') judge=$(echo "$P" | grep -c 'Do not run the test suite or the gate commands')"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `implementer fg=1 judge=0`, `reviewer fg=1 judge=1`, `verifier fg=1 judge=0`, one per line

### Requirement: The code reviewer judges the diff and leaves the suite and the gate to the verifier
Every copy of the code reviewer prompt SHALL say `Do not run the test suite or the gate commands: the verifier runs them on the same head`, and SHALL allow a narrow command that confirms a specific finding. No existing line of that prompt MAY be removed, and the verifier prompt MUST NOT change. The reviewer's composed input MUST NOT list the gate commands, while the implementer's and the verifier's inputs still SHALL.

#### Scenario: Every reviewer copy carries the rule, keeps every existing line, and the verifier prompt is unchanged
- WHEN `(F=$(printf '\140\140\140'); X=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-rev.txt; T=$(mktemp -d); sed -n '/^## 6\. Code reviewer/,/^## 7\. /p' docs/design.md | sed -n "/^${F}text\$/,/^${F}\$/p" | sed '1d;$d' > $X; for f in $X docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md factory/prompts/reviewer.md; do J=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $f | tr -s ' '); echo "judge=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'Do not run the test suite or the gate commands: the verifier runs them on the same head') narrow=$(echo "$J" | grep -c 'You may run a narrow command to confirm a specific finding')"; done; git show main:factory/prompts/reviewer.md > $T/a; git show main:docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md > $T/b; echo "copy=$(cmp -s $X docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md && echo SAME || echo DIFF) fill=$([ "$(diff factory/prompts/reviewer.md docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md | grep '^[<>]')" = "$(diff $T/a $T/b | grep '^[<>]')" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed) removed=$(git diff main...HEAD -- docs/prompts/06-code-reviewer.md factory/prompts/reviewer.md | grep -v '^---' | grep -c '^-') verifier_changed=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts/07-verifier.md factory/prompts/verifier.md | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints three lines, each exactly `judge=1 narrow=1`, then `copy=SAME fill=unchanged removed=0 verifier_changed=0`

#### Scenario: The reviewer's input no longer hands it the gate commands, and the implementer's and verifier's still do
Needs the GIVEN blocks of "A ruling on a BLOCKED park returns the sub-ticket to its implementer with the ruling" and "A reviewer that ends its turn waiting on its own commands is re-dispatched once, then parks as EMPTY-OUTPUT beside the verifier's passing rows" run once.
- WHEN `(. ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0023-parent.sh && . ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0032-checks.sh && for r in reviewer verifier implementer; do [ $r = implementer ] && bin/factory ticket set T-0001.1 status=ready-for-implementer 'in_flight=[]' >/dev/null; R=$(bin/factory run start --role $r --ticket T-0001.1 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | sed -n 's/.*"run_id": "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'); bin/factory run compose ${R:-none} >/dev/null 2>&1; I=$FACTORY_STATE/runs/${R:-none}/input.md; echo "$r gates=$(grep -c 'Gate commands (run each from your worktree' $I 2>/dev/null) told=$(grep -c 'The verifier runs the gate commands on this head; you do not run them' $I 2>/dev/null)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `reviewer gates=0 told=1`, `verifier gates=1 told=0`, `implementer gates=1 told=0`, one per line

### Requirement: The documents record the empty-output route
`docs/design.md` SHALL state the EMPTY-OUTPUT rule and its two routing-table rows, and SHALL list a second EMPTY-OUTPUT among the park reasons. `dev/build-harness.spec.md` SHALL describe EMPTY-OUTPUT and `run last-message`, and SHALL no longer describe a KILLED condition or seam. `README.md` SHALL no longer say that a run is parked for exceeding a budget, and SHALL describe the empty-output retry. `docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain an entry for issue #41, numbered without a gap. The change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The design doc states the EMPTY-OUTPUT rule, its rows and its park
- WHEN `(echo "rule=$(grep -c '^- A role run that ends without writing its output is EMPTY-OUTPUT' docs/design.md) rows=$(grep -c '^| Any role | EMPTY-OUTPUT' docs/design.md) parks=$(grep '^- A non-empty ESCALATIONS line' docs/design.md | grep -c 'a second EMPTY-OUTPUT in a row') kill=$(grep -c 'never recorded as a budget kill' docs/design.md)")`
- THEN it prints exactly `rule=1 rows=2 parks=1 kill=1`

#### Scenario: The build spec describes EMPTY-OUTPUT and no longer a KILLED condition
- WHEN `(echo "stale=$(grep -c 'KILLED condition\|KILLED seam' dev/build-harness.spec.md) empty=$(grep -c 'EMPTY-OUTPUT' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}') note=$(grep -c 'run last-message' dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '{print ($1 > 0)}')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `stale=0 empty=1 note=1`

#### Scenario: README drops the budget park and describes the empty-output retry
- WHEN `(echo "budget=$(grep -c 'exceeding its budget\|over budget' README.md) built=$(grep -c '^- \*\*Empty output\.\*\*' README.md) unstick=$(grep '^| \*\*Unstick\*\*' README.md | grep -c 'ended without output twice')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `budget=0 built=1 unstick=1`

#### Scenario: The changelog records issue 41 without a numbering gap
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. After issue #41 ' docs/changelog.md | grep -oF -e EMPTY-OUTPUT -e foreground -e 'last message' -e 're-dispatched once' -e 'gate commands' | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `5`

#### Scenario: The empty-output change adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The spec writer and the critic carry the turn-economy rules
Every copy of the spec writer prompt SHALL tell it to batch independent reads and commands, read line ranges once grep has found them, keep long output in a scratch file, and write the spec in as few writes as it can. Every copy of the critic prompt SHALL carry the same reading rules, its minimum spot-check, a rule that it runs no test suite, the rule for picking an acceptance command, a sentence allowing a small experiment in its scratch directory to confirm a finding, and the rule that turns a claim needing a suite run or a build of the change into a finding or a question; it MUST NOT cap a claim at a number of paths and commands or forbid a clone, worktree or prototype. Each design block MUST stay byte-identical to its `docs/prompts/` copy, and each run copy SHALL differ from it only as it did on `main`.

#### Scenario: Every critic copy drops the cap and the no-build rule and keeps the rest; every writer copy keeps its rules
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); Q=$(printf '\140\140\140'); printf '%s\n' 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn' 'read that line range, not the whole file' 'to a file in your scratch directory and grep or tail it' > $T/both; { cat $T/both; echo 'Write the spec in as few writes as you can'; } > $T/spec_writer; { cat $T/both; printf '%s\n' 'Spot-check at least 2 cited paths and 1 acceptance command yourself' 'Run no test suite' 'Pick an acceptance command that runs no test suite' 'small experiment in your scratch directory' 'is a finding for the writer, or a question'; } > $T/critic; printf '%s\n' 'Ground any one claim' 'build nothing' 'no clone, worktree or prototype' > $T/gone; for r in "2. Spec writer|02-spec-writer.md|spec_writer" "3. Spec critic|03-spec-critic.md|critic"; do h=${r%%|*}; x=${r#*|}; c=${x%%|*}; f=${x#*|}; git show main:factory/prompts/$f.md > $T/a; git show main:docs/prompts/$c > $T/b; echo "$f copy=$(awk -v h="## $h" -v q="$Q" '$0==h{s=1;next} s&&$0==q"text"{p=1;next} p&&$0==q{exit} p' docs/design.md | cmp -s - docs/prompts/$c && echo SAME || echo DIFF) doc=$(tr '\n' ' ' < docs/prompts/$c | tr -s ' ' | grep -oF -f $T/$f | sort -u | grep -c .)/$(grep -c . $T/$f) run=$(tr '\n' ' ' < factory/prompts/$f.md | tr -s ' ' | grep -oF -f $T/$f | sort -u | grep -c .)/$(grep -c . $T/$f) gone=$(for g in docs/prompts/$c factory/prompts/$f.md; do tr '\n' ' ' < $g | tr -s ' ' | grep -oF -f $T/gone; done | grep -c .) fill=$([ "$(diff factory/prompts/$f.md docs/prompts/$c | grep '^[<>]')" = "$(diff $T/a $T/b | grep '^[<>]')" ] && echo unchanged || echo changed)"; done)`
- THEN it prints exactly `spec_writer copy=SAME doc=4/4 run=4/4 gone=0 fill=unchanged`, then `critic copy=SAME doc=8/8 run=8/8 gone=0 fill=unchanged`. `doc` and `run` count the kept or added phrases found in the documented copy and the run copy, each joined into one line so a phrase may wrap; `gone` counts the removed phrases found in either.

### Requirement: Spec writer and critic runs receive the turn-economy rules
The system prompt that `run start` writes for a spec writer run SHALL contain the writer's turn-economy rule. The one it writes for a critic run SHALL contain the critic's reading rules, its no-suite rule and the sentence allowing a small scratch experiment, and MUST NOT contain the per-claim cap or the no-build rule.

#### Scenario: A critic run's prompt has the no-suite rule and the scratch allowance, and no cap or build ban
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); export FACTORY_STATE=$T/s; for i in 1 2; do printf "# F$i\n\nDo x.\n" > $T/req$i.md; bin/factory ticket new --file $T/req$i.md >/dev/null; done; bin/factory ticket set T-0001 status=ready-for-spec-writer >/dev/null; bin/factory ticket set T-0002 status=ready-for-critic >/dev/null; bin/factory run start --role spec_writer --ticket T-0001 >/dev/null 2>&1; bin/factory run start --role critic --ticket T-0002 >/dev/null 2>&1; W=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $FACTORY_STATE/runs/run-0001-spec_writer/system-prompt.txt | tr -s ' '); C=$(tr '\n' ' ' < $FACTORY_STATE/runs/run-0002-critic/system-prompt.txt | tr -s ' '); echo "spec_writer batch=$(printf "%s" "$W" | grep -c 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn') writes=$(printf "%s" "$W" | grep -c 'Write the spec in as few writes as you can')"; echo "critic batch=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Put independent reads and commands in one turn') suite=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Run no test suite') scratch=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'small experiment in your scratch directory') cap=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'Ground any one claim') build=$(printf "%s" "$C" | grep -c 'build nothing')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `spec_writer batch=1 writes=1`, then `critic batch=1 suite=1 scratch=1 cap=0 build=0`

### Requirement: Nothing else in the two prompts changes
The spec writer prompt copies SHALL stay as #73 left them at `05cf8f9`. In the critic prompt copies, everything before the PROCESS section and everything from ANTI-GOODHARTING on SHALL stay byte for byte as on `main`. No other file under `docs/prompts/`, `factory/prompts/` or `agents/` SHALL change.

#### Scenario: The writer prompt is as #73 left it, and only the critic's PROCESS changes
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d); n=0; for x in "docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md|1,/^PROCESS\$/p" "docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md|/^ANTI-GOODHARTING/,\$p" "factory/prompts/critic.md|1,/^PROCESS\$/p" "factory/prompts/critic.md|/^ANTI-GOODHARTING/,\$p"; do f=${x%%|*}; s=${x#*|}; git show main:$f | sed -n "$s" > $T/a; sed -n "$s" $f > $T/b; [ -s $T/a ] || n=$((n+100)); cmp -s $T/a $T/b || { n=$((n+1)); echo "changed: $f $s"; }; done; echo "sections_changed=$n writer=$(git diff --name-only 05cf8f9 HEAD -- docs/prompts/02-spec-writer.md factory/prompts/spec_writer.md | grep -c .) others=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- docs/prompts factory/prompts agents | grep -vxF -e docs/prompts/03-spec-critic.md -e factory/prompts/critic.md | grep -c .)")`
- THEN it prints only `sections_changed=0 writer=0 others=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the turn-economy change
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL hold one entry for issue #73, numbered without a gap. `docs/principles.md` principle 2 SHALL name the critic's no-suite rule among its mechanisms, SHALL no longer say the critic builds nothing, and SHALL say part B.2 is done by #41 for the code reviewer and by #73 for the critic.

#### Scenario: Principle 2 names the critic's no-suite rule and no longer its build ban
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; P=$(sed -n '/^### 2\. /,/^### 3\. /p' docs/principles.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "entries73=$(grep -c '^[0-9]*\. After issue #73 ' docs/changelog.md) implemented=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'runs no test suite (#73') builds=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'builds nothing') status=$(printf '%s' "$P" | grep -c 'done by #41 for the code reviewer and by #73 for the critic')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `CONTIGUOUS`, then `entries73=1 implemented=1 builds=0 status=1`

### Requirement: The documents record the critic revert
`docs/changelog.md` SHALL gain one entry for issue #74 as its last numbered entry, numbered without a gap, that records the replay result and the two removed rules. The Spiking section of `docs/principles.md` SHALL no longer bound the critic to two paths and one command or say it does not build, SHALL say the critic may run a small scratch check, SHALL say vetting a whole approach belongs to the spec writer or a spike, and SHALL record the replay. The change MUST add no whitespace errors.

#### Scenario: The changelog records the revert as its last entry
- WHEN `(awk '/^[0-9]+\. /{n++; if (index($0, n ". ") != 1) bad=1} END{print (bad ? "GAPPED" : "CONTIGUOUS")}' docs/changelog.md; grep '^[0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -oF -e '#74' -e replay -e 'per-claim cap' -e 'no-build rule' -e 'no test suite' -e UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR -e brace-list | sort -u | grep -c .)`
- THEN it prints `CONTIGUOUS`, then `7`

#### Scenario: The Spiking section allows a small scratch check and records the replay
- WHEN `(X=$(sed -n '/^## Spiking/,$p' docs/principles.md | tr '\n' ' ' | tr -s ' '); echo "bound=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'two paths, one command') nobuild=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'it does not build') scratch=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'small scratch check') whole=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'vetting a whole approach belongs to the spec writer') replay=$(printf '%s' "$X" | grep -c 'replay')")`
- THEN it prints exactly `bound=0 nobuild=0 scratch=1 whole=1 replay=1`

#### Scenario: The critic revert adds no whitespace errors
- WHEN `(git diff --check main...HEAD; echo "exit=$?")`
- THEN it prints only `exit=0`

### Requirement: The documents record the capability index
The triage prompt's design block, its `docs/prompts/` copy and the runtime prompt SHALL each carry the `Capabilities:` output line. `docs/design.md`, `dev/build-harness.spec.md` and the README's Triage, Spec writer and Spec critic rows MUST describe the capability index. `docs/changelog.md` MUST have an entry for issue #75, with no whitespace error in the change.

#### Scenario: The prompt copies, design, build spec, README and changelog name the capability index
- WHEN `(echo "docs-copy=$(grep -c '^Capabilities:' docs/prompts/01-triage.md) runtime=$(grep -c '^Capabilities:' factory/prompts/triage.md) changelog=$(grep -c '^[0-9]*\. After issue #75 ' docs/changelog.md) design=$(grep -q 'capability index' docs/design.md && echo y || echo n) build-spec=$(grep -q 'capability index' dev/build-harness.spec.md && echo y || echo n) readme=$(grep -E '^\| (Triage|Spec writer|Spec critic) \(' README.md | grep -c 'capability index')"; git diff --check main...HEAD && echo whitespace=ok)`
- THEN it prints exactly `docs-copy=1 runtime=1 changelog=1 design=y build-spec=y readme=3`, then `whitespace=ok`
