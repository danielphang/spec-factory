# harness-suite

## Requirements

### Requirement: The harness suite runs mid-edit without loosening the lock
The harness's own test suite SHALL pass in a checkout that has an uncommitted edit under a harness path, and a store command on an instance's own store run from such a checkout MUST still be refused.

#### Scenario: The harness suite passes with an uncommitted harness edit
The command gives pytest its own temporary directory under `/tmp`, because four existing tests need one outside every repository and instance. Run it as written, whatever `TMPDIR` the caller has set; it removes that directory when it ends.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && P=$(mktemp -d /tmp/t0023-suite.XXXXXX) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && echo '# uncommitted edit' >> $T/c/factory/status.py && cd $T/c && TMPDIR=$P .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | tail -1; rm -rf "$P")`
- THEN it prints one line reporting a number of passed tests and no `failed` or `error`

#### Scenario: The uncommitted-edit refusal still holds on an instance's own store
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && echo '# uncommitted edit' >> $T/c/factory/status.py && git init -q -b main $T/tgt && git -C $T/tgt -c user.email=f@x -c user.name=f commit -q --allow-empty -m init && cd $T/tgt && $T/c/bin/factory init --repo-name demo >/dev/null 2>&1 && $T/c/bin/factory config >/dev/null 2>$T/err; echo "exit=$?"; head -1 $T/err | grep -o 'has uncommitted changes:$')`
- THEN it prints `exit=2`, then `has uncommitted changes:`

### Requirement: Test files share code only through helper modules
No file of the harness suite SHALL import from another test file; code that more than one test file uses MUST live in a non-test helper module.

#### Scenario: No test file imports from another test file
- WHEN `.venv/bin/python -c 'import ast,pathlib; bad=[f"{p.name}:{n.lineno}" for p in sorted(pathlib.Path("tests/factory").glob("*.py")) for n in ast.walk(ast.parse(p.read_text())) if (isinstance(n,ast.ImportFrom) and (any(s.startswith("test_") for s in (n.module or "").split(".")) or any(a.name.startswith("test_") for a in n.names))) or (isinstance(n,ast.Import) and any(s.startswith("test_") for a in n.names for s in a.name.split(".")))]; print(f"cross-test imports: {len(bad)}", *bad)'`
- THEN it prints `cross-test imports: 0`

### Requirement: Each shared test helper is written once
The repository and entry-point constants, the call wrapper, the JSON reader, the ticket reader, the empty-repository setup and the approved-parent setup SHALL each be defined in exactly one place in the harness suite, and this stays a standing guard: a later test file that needs one of them imports it.

#### Scenario: The shared constants and wrappers are defined once
- WHEN `.venv/bin/python -c 'import ast,pathlib,collections; c=collections.Counter(t.id if isinstance(n,ast.Assign) else n.name for p in pathlib.Path("tests/factory").glob("*.py") for n in ast.parse(p.read_text()).body for t in (n.targets if isinstance(n,ast.Assign) else [n]) if isinstance(t,(ast.Name,ast.FunctionDef))); print(*(f"{k}={c[k]}" for k in ("REPO","BIN","run","js","ticket","git_repo","approved_parent")))'`
- THEN it prints `REPO=1 BIN=1 run=1 js=1 ticket=1 git_repo=1 approved_parent=1`

#### Scenario: The approved-parent and empty-repository setups are written once
- WHEN `.venv/bin/python -c 'import pathlib; L={p:p.read_text().splitlines() for p in sorted(pathlib.Path("tests/factory").glob("*.py"))}; ap=[f"{p.name}:{i+1}" for p,l in L.items() for i in range(1,len(l)-3) if "ready-for-spec-writer" in l[i-1] and "\"spec\", \"add\"" in l[i] and "\"spec:init\"" in l[i+1] and "awaiting-spec-gate" in l[i+2] and "\"approve-spec\"" in l[i+3] and "assert" not in l[i+3] and " = " not in l[i+3]]; gr=[f"{p.name}:{i+1}" for p,l in L.items() for i,x in enumerate(l) if "\"-b\", \"main\"" in x and "\"init\"" in x and any("--allow-empty" in y for y in l[i:i+4])]; print(f"approved-parent sequences: {len(ap)}", *ap); print(f"empty-commit repo setups: {len(gr)}", *gr)'`
- THEN each of the two lines reports either `0`, or `1` followed by a single site in `_cli.py`

### Requirement: The refactor keeps every test and assertion but the one duplicate
Across this change's own merges and unmerged commits, the harness suite SHALL lose exactly the one duplicate test and gain none, and every assert statement in every other test function MUST still be present in that function.

#### Scenario: Only the duplicate test and its assertions are gone
The command compares each `Merge factory/T-0045.<n>` commit reachable from HEAD with its first parent, and `git merge-base HEAD main` with HEAD, and adds up the results, so changes other tickets make to the same files are never counted. A collection failure shows as removed tests. tar may print a locale warning on stderr; it is not part of the result.
- WHEN `T=$(mktemp -d); { for m in $(git log --format=%H --grep='^Merge factory/T-0045[.]' HEAD); do echo "$(git rev-parse "$m^1") $m"; done; echo "$(git merge-base HEAD main) $(git rev-parse HEAD)"; } | while read b h; do [ "$b" = "$h" ] && continue; for s in $b $h; do [ -d "$T/$s" ] || { mkdir "$T/$s" && git archive "$s" | tar -x -C "$T/$s" && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" "$T/$s/.venv" && (cd "$T/$s" && PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest --collect-only -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | grep '::' | sort > ids); }; done; echo "pair $b $h"; comm -23 "$T/$b/ids" "$T/$h/ids" | sed 's/^/removed /'; comm -13 "$T/$b/ids" "$T/$h/ids" | sed 's/^/added /'; .venv/bin/python -c 'import ast,pathlib,sys; A=lambda r: {f"{p.name}::{n.name}": {ast.unparse(a) for a in ast.walk(n) if isinstance(a,ast.Assert)} for p in sorted(pathlib.Path(r,"tests/factory").glob("test_*.py")) for n in ast.walk(ast.parse(p.read_text())) if isinstance(n,(ast.FunctionDef,ast.AsyncFunctionDef)) and n.name.startswith("test_")}; b,h=A(sys.argv[1]),A(sys.argv[2]); [print(f"missing {k}: {a[:80]}") for k in sorted(b) for a in sorted(b[k]-h.get(k,set()))]' "$T/$b" "$T/$h"; done > "$T/out"; for k in pair removed added missing; do echo "$k: $(grep -c "^$k " "$T/out")"; grep "^$k " "$T/out" | grep -v '^pair '; done; rm -rf "$T"`
- THEN `pair:` is at least 1; `removed: 1` is followed by exactly `removed tests/factory/test_p0_cli.py::test_run_finish_without_output_is_killed`; it prints `added: 0`; and it prints `missing: 2`, followed by two lines that both start `missing test_p0_cli.py::test_run_finish_without_output_is_killed:`

#### Scenario: The suite is shorter
The command adds up the test-file line counts over the same pairs as the scenario above.
- WHEN `{ for m in $(git log --format=%H --grep='^Merge factory/T-0045[.]' HEAD); do echo "$(git rev-parse "$m^1") $m"; done; echo "$(git merge-base HEAD main) $(git rev-parse HEAD)"; } | while read b h; do [ "$b" = "$h" ] && continue; for s in $b $h; do printf '%s ' $(git ls-tree --name-only "$s" tests/factory/ | grep '\.py$' | while read f; do git show "$s:$f"; done | wc -l); done; echo; done | awk '{n++; b+=$1; h+=$2} END {print "pairs: " n+0 "; test lines before: " b+0 ", after: " h+0 ", change: " h-b}'`
- THEN `pairs` is at least 1 and `change` is negative, and the verifier reports the line

### Requirement: A suite run writes nothing into the checkout
A run of the harness suite SHALL pass and leave every path of the checkout as it was, except pytest's own cache of the test modules in `tests/factory/__pycache__`.

#### Scenario: A suite run in a fresh clone passes and adds nothing to the checkout
The command gives pytest its own temporary directory under `/tmp`, as the existing harness-suite scenario does, and removes it when it ends.
- WHEN `(T=$(mktemp -d) && P=$(mktemp -d /tmp/t0045-suite.XXXXXX) && git clone -q --no-checkout . $T/c && git -C $T/c checkout -q $(git rev-parse HEAD) && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" $T/c/.venv && cd $T/c && find . \( -path ./.git -o -path ./tests/factory/__pycache__ \) -prune -o -print | sort > $T/before && TMPDIR=$P .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | tail -1; find . \( -path ./.git -o -path ./tests/factory/__pycache__ \) -prune -o -print | sort > $T/after; echo "paths changed: $(comm -3 $T/before $T/after | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"; comm -3 $T/before $T/after; rm -rf "$P")`
- THEN the first line reports a number of passed tests and no `failed` or `error`, and the next line is `paths changed: 0` with nothing after it

### Requirement: One harness-suite run finishes in under three minutes
One run of the harness suite, as `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory` runs it after `uv sync --frozen`, SHALL pass every test and finish in under 180 seconds on the operator's machine.

#### Scenario: One suite run passes in under three minutes
Run every command in this change from the repository root of the checkout under test, after `uv sync --frozen`, with `git` and `node` on `PATH`. Each WHEN runs in a subshell.
- GIVEN the script written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown (every later scenario of this change that names it reuses it)

```sh
cat > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0051-time.py <<'EOF'
# .venv/bin/python t0051-time.py N LIMIT CMD...: from the checkout under test, starts N copies of the shell
# command CMD at once, each with its own fresh TMPDIR under /tmp, and stops any copy still running
# LIMIT seconds after the start. Prints one line per copy, in order: its output's last line, or
# `stopped`, then ` | under LIMIT s` or ` | over LIMIT s` by its own wall time.
import os, shutil, subprocess, sys, tempfile, time
n, limit, cmd = int(sys.argv[1]), float(sys.argv[2]), " ".join(sys.argv[3:])
t0, runs = time.monotonic(), []
for _ in range(n):
    d = tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix="t0051-time.", dir="/tmp")
    runs.append((d, subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, text=True,
                                     env={**os.environ, "TMPDIR": d}, start_new_session=True)))
for d, p in runs:
    try:
        out, _ = p.communicate(timeout=max(0.1, limit - (time.monotonic() - t0)))
        last, took = (out.strip().splitlines() or [""])[-1], time.monotonic() - t0
    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
        os.killpg(p.pid, 9); p.communicate(); last, took = "stopped", limit + 1
    shutil.rmtree(d, ignore_errors=True)
    print(f"{last} | {'under' if took < limit else 'over'} {limit:g} s")
EOF
```

- WHEN `.venv/bin/python ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0051-time.py 1 180 .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory`
- THEN it prints one line that reports a number of passed tests, contains no `failed` or `error`, and ends with `| under 180 s`

### Requirement: Two harness-suite runs at once each finish in under five minutes
Two runs of the harness suite started at the same moment SHALL each pass every test and finish in under 300 seconds on the operator's machine.

#### Scenario: Two suite runs at once each pass in under five minutes
Needs the GIVEN block of "One suite run passes in under three minutes" run once.
- WHEN `.venv/bin/python ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0051-time.py 2 300 .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory`
- THEN it prints two lines, each of which reports a number of passed tests, contains no `failed` or `error`, and ends with `| under 300 s`

### Requirement: The suite's stand-in agent replies when several copies of one role start at once
Each stand-in for the `claude` program that the harness suite's driver tests use MUST reply with its JSON object and exit 0 when several copies of the same role start at the same moment and share one log.

#### Scenario: Four stand-ins of one role started together all reply, 200 times over
The script names the suite's helper module and its two stand-in programs, because this ticket's subject is the suite's own reliability (as the standing 2026-10-12 T-0045 decision allows for the suite's structure).
- GIVEN the script written by the block below, run once at column 0 as shown

```sh
cat > ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0051-standin.py <<'EOF'
# .venv/bin/python t0051-standin.py, from the checkout under test: for each stand-in `claude` of the
# harness suite (the intake one and the build one), 200 times, starts four copies of the same role
# at once from four run directories that share one log, as the driver does for the checkers of four
# sub-tickets. Prints `<stand-in>: 200 rounds, <n> with a copy that did not reply, counter <c>`, where
# a copy that did not reply exited non-zero or printed no JSON object, and <c> is the stand-in's own
# count of verifier calls at the end (800 when no call was lost).
import json, os, subprocess, sys, tempfile, pathlib
sys.path.insert(0, "tests")
from factory import _fixtures as F  # the suite's helper module (tests/factory/_fixtures.py)
for name in ("STANDIN", "BUILD_STANDIN"):
    t = pathlib.Path(tempfile.mkdtemp()); exe = t / "claude"
    exe.write_text(getattr(F, name).format(python=sys.executable)); exe.chmod(0o755)
    env = {**os.environ, "STANDIN_LOG": str(t / "claude.log"), "STANDIN_PLAYS": json.dumps({"verifier": [{"say": "x"}]})}
    bad = 0
    for i in range(200):
        dirs = [t / f"r{i}" / f"run-000{k}-verifier" for k in (1, 2, 3, 4)]
        for d in dirs:
            d.mkdir(parents=True)
        ps = [subprocess.Popen([str(exe)], cwd=d, env=env, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True) for d in dirs]
        res = [(p.wait(), p.stdout.read()) for p in ps]
        def replied(rc, out):
            try:
                return rc == 0 and isinstance(json.loads(out), dict)
            except ValueError:
                return False
        bad += not all(replied(rc, out) for rc, out in res)
    nf = t / "claude.log.n-verifier"
    print(f"{name}: 200 rounds, {bad} with a copy that did not reply, counter {nf.read_text().strip() if nf.exists() else 'none'}")
EOF
```

- WHEN `.venv/bin/python -B ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/t0051-standin.py`
- THEN it prints exactly `STANDIN: 200 rounds, 0 with a copy that did not reply, counter 800`, then `BUILD_STANDIN: 200 rounds, 0 with a copy that did not reply, counter 800`

### Requirement: This change keeps every test and assertion but the two the waiting park reason changes
Across this change's own merges and unmerged commits, the harness suite SHALL lose no test, and every assert statement in every existing test function MUST still be present in that function, except the two assertions listed under Tests to change.

#### Scenario: No test is removed and only the two listed assertions change
The command compares each `Merge factory/T-0051.<n>` commit reachable from HEAD with its first parent, and `git merge-base HEAD main` with HEAD, and adds up the results, so changes other tickets make to the same files are never counted. A collection failure shows as removed tests. tar may print a locale warning on stderr; it is not part of the result.
- WHEN `T=$(mktemp -d); { for m in $(git log --format=%H --grep='^Merge factory/T-0051[.]' HEAD); do echo "$(git rev-parse "$m^1") $m"; done; echo "$(git merge-base HEAD main) $(git rev-parse HEAD)"; } | while read b h; do [ "$b" = "$h" ] && continue; for s in $b $h; do [ -d "$T/$s" ] || { mkdir "$T/$s" && git archive "$s" | tar -x -C "$T/$s" && ln -s "$PWD/.venv" "$T/$s/.venv" && (cd "$T/$s" && PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest --collect-only -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | grep '::' | sort > ids); }; done; echo "pair $b $h"; comm -23 "$T/$b/ids" "$T/$h/ids" | sed 's/^/removed /'; comm -13 "$T/$b/ids" "$T/$h/ids" | sed 's/^/added /'; .venv/bin/python -c 'import ast,pathlib,sys; A=lambda r: {f"{p.name}::{n.name}": {ast.unparse(a) for a in ast.walk(n) if isinstance(a,ast.Assert)} for p in sorted(pathlib.Path(r,"tests/factory").glob("test_*.py")) for n in ast.walk(ast.parse(p.read_text())) if isinstance(n,(ast.FunctionDef,ast.AsyncFunctionDef)) and n.name.startswith("test_")}; b,h=A(sys.argv[1]),A(sys.argv[2]); [print(f"missing {k}: {a[:80]}") for k in sorted(b) for a in sorted(b[k]-h.get(k,set()))]' "$T/$b" "$T/$h"; done > "$T/out"; for k in pair removed added missing; do echo "$k: $(grep -c "^$k " "$T/out")"; grep "^$k " "$T/out" | grep -v '^pair '; done; rm -rf "$T"`
- THEN `pair:` is at least 1; it prints `removed: 0`; every `added` line names a test in `tests/factory/test_empty_output.py`; and it prints `missing: 2`, followed by exactly one line that starts `missing test_drive.py::test_two_empty_outputs_park_with_both_runs_and_keep_the_last_message: assert parked['reason'] == 'EMPTY-OUTPUT from triage'` and one that starts `missing test_empty_output.py::test_last_message_is_kept_for_an_empty_output_run: assert res == {'ok': True, 'run_id': s.rid, 'last_message':`

### Requirement: The suite tests the launch copy, a reformatted reply and the route back to checks, and changes no existing test
The harness suite SHALL pass with no existing test file changed or deleted. The test files this change adds SHALL each fail, with at least one failed test, when run against the harness code of the change's base.

#### Scenario: The suite passes, no existing test changes, and every test file this change adds fails on the base
Per the standing T-0023 decision, the command gives pytest its own temporary directory under `/tmp` and removes it when it ends. The base is `git merge-base HEAD main`; its tree is unpacked into that directory, and the added files are copied in beside its tests.
- WHEN `(P=$(mktemp -d /tmp/t0054-suite.XXXXXX) && TMPDIR=$P uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | tail -1; B=$(git merge-base HEAD main); echo "changed=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=DMR $B HEAD -- tests | grep -c .) added=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=A $B HEAD -- tests | grep -c '/test_[^/]*\.py$')"; mkdir $P/base && git archive $B | tar -x -C $P/base && for f in $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=A $B HEAD -- tests); do mkdir -p $P/base/${f%/*} && cp $f $P/base/$f; done; for f in $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=A $B HEAD -- tests | grep '/test_[^/]*\.py$'); do echo "$f on the base: $(cd $P/base && TMPDIR=$P uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider $f 2>&1 | tail -1 | sed 's/ in [0-9.]*s.*//')"; done; rm -rf "$P")`
- THEN the first line reports a number of passed tests and no `failed` or `error`; the second is `changed=0 added=<n>` with n at least 1; then n lines follow, each `<added test file> on the base: <pytest summary>`, where every summary includes `failed`
