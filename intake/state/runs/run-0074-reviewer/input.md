## Context for this run (composed by the harness, not part of the request)

Repository: `spec-factory`, the design repo at `~/dev/spec-factory` (branch `main`). It holds
documents, not code: `docs/spec-factory.md` (the design document, source of truth),
`specs/build-harness.md` (the spec for building the harness), `plans/` (the Planner's
decompositions; `plans/P0-intake-skeleton.md` is the walking skeleton), and `prompts/`
(each file a verbatim copy of one prompt block in the design doc; it changes only by
re-copying that block). Your shell may start in another directory: use absolute paths, or
`cd ~/dev/spec-factory && <cmd>`.

The REFERENCE implementation is the Nanobot-side harness at `~/dev/nanobot-upstream/factory/`
(branch `feat/lionbot-v3`, built from `plans/P0-intake-skeleton.md`). Read it only to observe
what a fix does today; never write there, and never copy its test names, line numbers or
commit SHAs into a spec. Never read or write `~/.nanobot/` (live credentials).

Acceptance commands must be runnable as written from `~/dev/spec-factory` (grep, sed, diff,
`git diff --check` against the documents). A change to the design doc keeps its own
conventions: the Changelog section at its end, `specs/build-harness.md` consistent with the
new text, and any `prompts/` file whose block changed re-copied from it.

The request is an issue draft, written from a real pipeline run: where in the documents,
what happened (the evidence), why it matters, a proposed fix, and the Nanobot-side commit
where a harness fix already exists. The evidence is the requirement; the proposed fix is the
requester's suggestion, not a requirement. Verify the as-built fix in the reference harness
before relying on it; a NEW criterion that already passes on this checkout proves nothing.

STATUS / CONFIDENCE / ESCALATIONS trailer, to the file named under "Output file" below. That
is the only file you may create or modify. Then return the same text as your final message.

## Sub-ticket T-0012.5

## T-0012.5 / Design-doc and build-spec text for `.factory/` instances

Parent: `intake/state/specs/T-0012/v3.md`. Read it for context. Do NOT implement parts outside this sub-ticket.

Depends on: T-0012.2

Parallel-safe: yes, with T-0012.1, .3, .4 and .6. Its only files are `docs/design.md`, `docs/changelog.md` and `dev/build-harness.spec.md`, which no sibling edits after T-0012.2. It touches no harness path, so it may merge after T-0012.6 without changing the harness revision.

Scope: F.1–F.4.
- The changelog entry is numbered one past the last entry at merge time (42 today).
- `## Responses` in `dev/build-harness.spec.md` stays as written.
- Neither replaced line in `docs/design.md` (the "Role-context block" paragraph, piece 8's row) is inside a prompt block, so no `docs/prompts/` file changes. Prompt-copies-moved-unchanged checks this.

Acceptance:
- **design-doc-instance-text** → NEW [specs/repo-layout]. THEN `kept=1 open=0 piece8=1 logged=1`.
- **build-spec-render-paths** → NEW [specs/repo-layout]. THEN `stale=0 new=N d8=1`, N ≥ 3. Today, at `specs/build-harness.md`, the three stale hits before `## Responses` (line 523) are lines 145, 158 and 456, the ones F.4 names.
- **changelog-entry-appended** → NEW (intermediate; F.3).
  - WHEN `grep '^[0-9][0-9]*\. ' docs/changelog.md | tail -1 | grep -c "^$(($(git show main:docs/changelog.md | grep -c '^[0-9][0-9]*\. ')+1))\. After issue #19 (2026-10-02):"`
  - THEN `1`.
- **responses-unchanged** → REGRESSION (relabelled by the operator, 2026-10-03: an invariant, passes at base; verifier run-0071) (intermediate; F.4).
  - WHEN `diff <(git show main:dev/build-harness.spec.md | awk '/^## Responses/{f=1} f') <(awk '/^## Responses/{f=1} f' dev/build-harness.spec.md) >/dev/null; echo "exit=$?"`
  - THEN `exit=0`.
- **changelog-moved-verbatim** → REGRESSION. THEN `SAME`, then `declined=1 numbering=CONTIGUOUS in_design=0`. The appended entry is beyond the compared head and keeps numbering contiguous.
- **design-text-kept** → REGRESSION. THEN `0`. The only two rewritten lines are the ones the scenario excludes.
- **prompt-copies-moved-unchanged** → REGRESSION. THEN `changed=0 of 10 VERBATIM`.
- **no-old-paths, documents only** → REGRESSION (the T-0012.2 intermediate). THEN `exit=1`.
- **whitespace (sub-ticket diff)** → REGRESSION. `exit=0`.

Tests to change: none

Protected paths: none

Out of scope:
- Building `factory render` / `render --check`.
- Reconciling the build spec's third meaning of `factory init` (the parent's out-of-scope observation).
- Editing any changelog entry other than the appended one.
- `README.md` (E).

## Shared plan context (from the plan; applies to every sub-ticket)

Six sub-tickets, one for each lettered part. The spec's seam list is a real dependency chain (A, then B, then C, then E), and each part is reviewed differently: A by mechanical comparison against green, B and C by reading code and tests, D as pure renames, E as an instance cutover, and F as design prose. Merging any two of them would mix those review modes in one diff. D and F are small enough to merge into one, but F's prose edits would then sit inside a rename diff, which makes the renames harder to verify. So they stay separate.

Order and parallelism:

```
T-0012.1 (A) ─┐
              ├─> T-0012.3 (B) ─> T-0012.4 (C) ─┐
T-0012.2 (D) ─┤                                  ├─> T-0012.6 (E)
              └─> T-0012.5 (F)                   │
              (T-0012.2 also feeds E directly) ──┘
```

- T-0012.1 and T-0012.2 can run in parallel. Their file sets do not overlap (see each ticket).
- T-0012.3 waits for both. That way B's preamble can be checked byte for byte against `docs/prompts/00-preamble.md`, and role-prompt-text-unchanged runs verbatim at B.
- T-0012.5 needs only T-0012.2, and it can run in parallel with .1, .3, .4 and .6, because it edits only `docs/design.md`, `docs/changelog.md` and `dev/build-harness.spec.md`.
- T-0012.6 is the **last sub-ticket that may touch harness paths**. Nothing that edits `factory/`, `bin/factory`, `agents/`, `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock` runs in parallel with it or merges after it unless that change also rewrites `.factory/harness.lock` (parent E.3; Risk, "Lock behaviour after close"). This includes fix-ups to .1, .3 and .4.

Planner choices the spec left open:
- **`intake/green-pilot/` moves to `.factory/green-pilot/`**, byte-identical, and `intake/answers/` moves to `.factory/answers/`, as E.5 says. `dev/` and `docs/` are ruled out. Both are in the pathspec of no-old-paths-in-live-files, and 23 of the 148 tracked pilot files contain matching old-path strings (`git grep -c <the scenario's patterns> -- intake/green-pilot | wc -l` → `23`). Records may not be rewritten. `.factory/**` is `infra` in E's protected paths, which suits closed records.
- **T-0012.6 (E) puts the moved suite into instance B's gate** (`.factory/instance.yaml`, E.1). During the build, every sub-ticket from T-0012.1 onward also runs the suite as a REGRESSION check in its own acceptance. That holds whether or not the operator does the optional step 1.
- **C.1 (the harness-revision function) is built in T-0012.3 (B)**, not T-0012.4. B.5 (`init` writes `.factory/harness.lock`) and B.6 (`paths` prints `harness_revision`) both need it, and B comes before C. C.2–C.5 (enforcement) stay in T-0012.4. This moves where the code lands. It does not change what the spec asks for.

Readings applied to every sub-ticket (from the spec's own text, not new design):
- `<harness>` in C.1 and C.4 is the **running** checkout: the one whose `bin/factory` is executing. The requirements say "running harness revision" and "running harness checkout". The `harness:` key in `instance.yaml` does not change which checkout is checked. At close, `~/dev/spec-factory-harness` does not exist yet (operator step 2 creates it), and instance-b-opens-every-ticket runs the dev checkout's own `bin/factory`.
- `BASE` in the parent scenarios is the parent's recorded base, for every sub-ticket. Sub-ticket gates use `main...HEAD`.
- Scenarios that call `bin/factory` need the checkout's `.venv`. Without it, `bin/factory` falls back to the system `python3` (green's `bin/factory`: `[[ -x "$PY" ]] || PY="python3"`), which may lack `pyyaml`. Each such sub-ticket therefore starts its acceptance with `uv sync --frozen`.
- Parent scenarios are cited by name. Their WHEN command and THEN result are exactly as written in the parent spec file named in brackets; I did not retype the long commands, to avoid transcription drift. Intermediate checks are written out in full.

## Parent spec (v3, pinned)

=== proposal.md
## Problem

The spec factory is a set of AI agents (triage, spec writer, critic, planner, implementer, checkers) plus a small program, the **harness**, that moves each piece of work (a **ticket**) from agent to agent, keeps the records, and enforces the rules no prompt can enforce. The harness's code lives inside the first project it was built for, a fork of the Nanobot app (`~/dev/nanobot-upstream`, branch `feat/lionbot-v3`, called "green" below). It is also wired to that project. It finds three things by looking next to its own code: its configuration, its **store** (the folder of ticket records and agent run outputs), and the **role-context block**, a short per-repository briefing that every agent reads first (which repository, how to run its tests, what kind of request to expect).

So the harness can serve only the repository it lives in. The operator, who already runs it on a second repository (this one), keeps a hand-made copy that drifts from the original, and every new project that adopts the factory would have to make the same copy.

Concretely, the only way to point the factory at a second repository is to copy the code out by hand and overwrite those files. That is how it runs against this design repository today. A script copies a pinned revision of green's harness into an ignored folder and overwrites three files. The pin is a commit id that someone updates by hand. A wrong briefing misleads every agent at once. The checking agents read the same briefing as the authors, so they share the error instead of catching it.

This repository's own layout makes it worse. Four things are mixed together, and the folder names do not say which is which:
- the design (one 759-line document that also holds the 41-item changelog);
- copies of the agents' instructions. The README says they are regenerated from the design document, but nothing regenerates them;
- the working documents for building the factory itself. They sit in `specs/` and `plans/`, the names the design reserves for the factory's own output;
- the install that actually runs the factory on this repository, `intake/`. It calls itself scratch and says to delete it, but it holds twelve tickets of records.

This affects two groups:
- The operator, who runs the factory against two repositories and keeps two drifting copies.
- Anyone who adopts the factory for a new project.

The change has two parts:
- Move the harness code into this repository, with its history, and give each target repository a small `.factory/` folder. That folder holds the repository's configuration, its briefing, the harness revision it has accepted, and its records, so one harness checkout serves many repositories.
- Rename this repository's documents so each folder says what it holds.

Moving green itself onto the new layout is a separate, later ticket.

## Evidence

All commands were run from `~/dev/spec-factory`, branch `main`. During this run, `main` moved from `239ef5f` to `f082708`, but only `issues/README.md` changed. Green (read-only reference) is at its latest pilot merge, subject `Merge factory/T-0002.1: …`. Below that commit is called **G**: `git -C ~/dev/nanobot-upstream log -1 --format=%H --grep='^Merge factory/T-0002.1' feat/lionbot-v3`, which today is green's HEAD.

**The harness locates everything relative to its own code** (green, read with `grep`/`sed`):
- `factory/store.py`: `REPO_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent` and `CONFIG_PATH = …/"config.yaml"` next to the package. `state_root()` is `FACTORY_STATE` or `REPO_ROOT / cfg["state_dir"]`.
- `factory/gitops.py`: `repo_root()` is `FACTORY_REPO` or `store.REPO_ROOT`.
- `factory/compose.py`: `PROMPTS = Path(__file__).resolve().parent / "prompts"`. The composed input starts with `(PROMPTS / "context.md")`.
- `factory/cli.py`, `run start`: the system prompt is `PROMPTS/preamble.md` + `PROMPTS/<role>.md`.
- `bin/factory`: `cd "$HERE"` (the harness checkout), then `exec "$PY" -m factory`. So a cwd-based lookup inside the package sees the harness directory, not the caller's.
- The four role agent definitions (`.claude/agents/factory-{triage,spec-writer,spec-critic,planner}.md`) each say ``Read `factory/prompts/preamble.md` before anything else``. That is a path relative to the target repo.
- `factory/compose.py` and five places in `factory/cli.py` call `gitops.repo_root`, so composing a role input depends on the repo root, not only the build commands.
- `request_dir` (line 6 of `intake/instance/config.yaml`, `../../issues`) is read by no harness code: `grep -rn request_dir factory/*.py factory/workflows/` on green prints nothing (exit 1).
- `factory init` exists on green and does something else: it creates the spec-store tree inside the store (`specstore.init`).
- Green's per-repo text is only in `factory/config.yaml`, `factory/prompts/context.md`, and two lines of `factory/prompts/preamble.md`. The first is line 1 (`{repo name}` filled). The second is the protected-paths line (`diff ~/dev/nanobot-upstream/factory/prompts/preamble.md intake/instance/preamble.md` differs only on lines 1 and 38). The seven role prompts in `factory/prompts/` have no repo-specific text: `grep -i 'nanobot\|knowledge_vault\|lionbot'` over them, excluding preamble and context, prints nothing. Gate commands reach the implementer and verifier through their input, not their prompt.

**The second install is a hand copy.** `intake/setup.sh` runs `git -C "$SRC" archive "$PIN" factory bin/factory | tar -x`, then copies `instance/preamble.md`, `instance/context.md` and `instance/config.yaml` over the result. `intake/HARNESS_PIN` holds green's pilot-merge commit. `intake/README.md:1` is `# intake/ — SCRATCH`, and it says "Delete the whole directory once the issues are filed and closed". `git ls-files intake | grep -v '^intake/state/'` lists 168 files (167 without `intake/.gitignore`). The live store, `intake/state/tickets/`, holds T-0001 to T-0012.

**The documents.** `README.md:11`: "The design doc is the source of truth; `prompts/` is regenerated from it." Nothing regenerates them: this repo has no code, and green has no `factory/render.py`. `docs/spec-factory.md` is 759 lines. Its Changelog runs from line 678 and has 41 numbered entries. Line 52 ends "Where the block is kept, and how a harness serving more than one repo picks the right one, are not fixed here." References to the paths that would move (`git grep` outside the stores) are in `README.md`, `plans/build-harness.md` (9 "Parent:" lines), `plans/P0-intake-skeleton.md:3`, `intake/README.md`, `intake/instance/context.md`, and historical operator answers under `intake/answers/`.

**Green's suite and its config dependence** (trials in a scratch copy: `git archive` of `factory bin/factory tests/factory` from green, run with green's venv, `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 … pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory`; nothing was written in green):
- With green's own config: `70 passed in 92.22s`.
- With this repo's instance config (`intake/instance/config.yaml`): `1 failed, 69 passed`. The failing test checks that an untracked lockfile named in the config's `environment_files` is copied into each worktree. Green lists `uv.lock` there; this repo lists none.
- With this repo's config plus `environment_files: ["uv.lock"]`: `70 passed in 93.51s`.

Every test drives `bin/factory` as a subprocess with `cwd` set to the harness checkout, which it finds as `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]`. Moving the tests out of `tests/factory/` would change that root, and running them from a checkout that has its own `.factory/` would give them that instance's config.

**History extraction works** (trial in scratch, green untouched): `git clone --no-local --single-branch --branch feat/lionbot-v3 ~/dev/nanobot-upstream g`, then `git filter-repo --path factory/ --path bin/factory --path tests/factory/ --path-glob '.claude/agents/factory-*' --path-rename .claude/agents/:agents/`, gave 31 commits. `git pull --no-rebase --allow-unrelated-histories` of that into a scratch clone of this repo merged without conflict. Afterwards, acceptance item harness-history-carried printed `0` (`24` on `main` today), and role-prompt-text-unchanged printed `changed=1 of 14`. The one difference is the preamble, which part B replaces.

**The document split works** (trial in the same scratch clone: `git mv` plus an `awk` cut of the Changelog section): docs-moved-and-split printed `old_tracked=0`; changelog-moved-verbatim printed `SAME` / `declined=1 numbering=CONTIGUOUS in_design=0`; design-text-kept printed `0`; prompt-copies-moved-unchanged printed `changed=0 of 10 VERBATIM`.

**Sequencing facts.** Green's harness tickets #16 and #18 are merged and closed. `issues/README.md` on `main` (`f082708`) now says #20 and #21 come "after #19", and that "#13, #14 fold in" to #21. Both are "not in intake yet". `uv sync --frozen` here today prints `error: No \`pyproject.toml\` found in current directory or any parent directory`.

## Root cause

The harness treats "the repo I serve" as "the repo I live in":
- `store.REPO_ROOT` and `store.CONFIG_PATH` (config), `store.state_root` (store), `gitops.repo_root` (target repo), `compose.PROMPTS/context.md` (role-context block), and `cli` `run start` (preamble with the repo name and protected paths filled) all resolve from the package's own location.
- `bin/factory` also changes into the harness directory before the package runs, so the caller's location is lost.

The only per-repo seams are the three environment overrides (`FACTORY_STATE`, `FACTORY_REPO`, `FACTORY_INTEGRATION_BRANCH`). They cannot supply config, briefing or preamble. Hence `intake/setup.sh`'s copy and overwrite.

The document confusion is historical. The design doc grew its changelog in place, `prompts/` was copied by hand, the factory's own build spec and plan were filed under the output directory names, and `intake/` started as scratch and became the self-hosting install.

## Out of scope

- **Instance A (green) cutover.** This change does not remove `factory/`, `bin/factory`, `tests/factory/` or the agent files from green, move `knowledge_vault/spec_factory/`, write green's `.factory/`, or run `factory init` there. Nothing is written under `~/dev/nanobot-upstream/`. Green keeps running its in-tree copy until its own paired ticket, driven by the Driver session.
- **Building `factory render` / `render --check`.** Only the build spec's text about them changes (part F). `docs/prompts/` stays a set of verbatim copies, re-copied by hand.
- **Role-prompt wording** (the seven role prompts and the agent definitions' role text stay byte-identical), the routing table, the store's record format, the OpenSpec tree (instance B gets no `openspec/`; `factory init` keeps creating it only where it already did, or in a new instance), and the simplifier role (#15).
- **The text of #13 and #14.** They fold into #21, which comes after #19.
- **Agent files for instance B.** This repo keeps dispatching with inline roles; no `.claude/agents/` is added here.
- **Rewriting records.** Store files, `intake/answers/*` and the green-pilot store move byte-identical, and old paths quoted inside them stay as written.
- **Moving the live store** (`intake/state/` to `.factory/state/`) and deleting `intake/harness/`. This happens after close, as an operator step (below).

## Open questions

none. The choices the request left to the planner stay with the planner: where `intake/green-pilot/` goes (subject to it moving byte-identical out of `intake/`), the order of the sub-tickets within the dependencies under design.md, and which sub-ticket puts the moved suite into this instance's gate. The design calls this spec makes are under Decisions, and the gate can override any of them.

## Decisions

- **The lock pins the harness's own code, not the checkout's HEAD.** The harness revision is the last commit that touched `factory/`, `bin/factory`, `agents/`, `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock`. A HEAD lock would refuse after every store or document commit in this repo, which is both the harness and instance B.
- **The lock guards the instance's own store only.** A run against any other store (`FACTORY_STATE` pointing elsewhere, as every test does) is not checked.
- **`FACTORY_INSTANCE` is added as an override** (the path of a `.factory/` directory), beside the walk-up. The workflows' clerk runs from the harness checkout, where the walk-up would find the harness repo's own instance, and the tests need a fixed instance.
- **The repo root is the parent of the instance directory**, whatever it is named; `FACTORY_REPO` still overrides it. The test conftest sets `FACTORY_REPO` to the harness checkout so the imported tests keep today's repo root.
- **`request_dir` is not carried into `.factory/instance.yaml`.** No harness code reads it, and its value is relative to a directory this change removes.
- **No fallback.** When no instance is found, the command is refused and nothing is written. The harness never uses an instance of its own by default.
- **No per-instance preamble file.** The harness keeps the design doc's preamble block verbatim and, at run start, fills `{repo name}` and the protected-path line from `instance.yaml`. The protected-path line is generated from the globs as `class (glob, glob), …`. Instances B and A lose their hand-written prose on that line (for example "never read or written by any role"); such notes belong in `context.md`.
- **The agent definitions' preamble pointer** changes to the run directory's `system-prompt.txt`, which `run start` already writes with the filled preamble. The role text below it is unchanged.
- **One `factory init` verb.** It is idempotent and creates whatever is missing: the instance, the briefing stub, the lock, the store with today's spec-store tree, and the agent files. `--repo-name` is required only when `instance.yaml` is missing.
- **The tests stay at `tests/factory/`**, not `tests/`, because they locate the checkout two levels up. A new `tests/factory/conftest.py` points them at a fixed test instance (one test needs `environment_files: ["uv.lock"]`; see Evidence). No existing test file changes.
- **Two checkouts for instance B (operator, at the gate).** Tickets are built and merged in the **dev** checkout, `~/dev/spec-factory` on `main`. Instance B runs from a separate **runtime** checkout: a git worktree of this repo at `~/dev/spec-factory-harness`, detached at the revision B has accepted and installed with `uv sync --frozen`. `harness:` in `.factory/instance.yaml` names the runtime by absolute path; it is the checkout that dispatchers and operators run, and `factory paths` reports it. A merge into `main` never changes the running code. **Upgrading** is a deliberate step, done when no ticket is in flight: move the runtime with `git -C ~/dev/spec-factory-harness checkout --detach <sha>`, then run `--accept-harness <sha>` in each instance that uses it. One runtime serves every target ("one checkout, many targets").
- **The lock also refuses a modified runtime (operator, at the gate).** See C.4. A runtime holds only committed, accepted code, so an uncommitted edit to harness paths there is refused rather than run unnoticed.
- **Instance B's gate adds the moved suite**: `uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory`, next to `git diff --check main...HEAD`. Instance B's protected paths add a `harness` class (`factory/**`, `bin/factory`, `agents/**`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`) and `.factory/**` under `infra`, and `generated` follows the copies to `docs/prompts/**`.
- **#13 and #14 are not carried.** No #13/#14 text merges while this parent is in flight. `main` already folds them into #21, after #19.
- **Part A runs `git filter-repo` only on a fresh clone of green in a scratch directory**, never in `~/dev/nanobot-upstream`.
- **Green-only files are not in this repo's tree at close:** `factory/config.yaml`, `factory/prompts/{context,preamble}.md` as green has them, and `scripts/full_suite_gate.py`. They may appear in the imported history.
- **The live store moves after close** (operator note at intake). Until then `.factory/instance.yaml` names `intake/state` as its store.

## Risk

**Blast radius.** This repo's whole layout, and every instance B run after close, which then reads a new config location and runs the in-repo harness. The history grows by about 31 imported commits. Green is unaffected until its own ticket.

**Lock behaviour after close.** Merges into `main` do not move the runtime, so they never trip the lock. Only the upgrade step does: after moving the runtime, instance B refuses store commands until the operator runs `--accept-harness`. A build workflow in flight at that moment parks the ticket as a harness bug, which is why upgrades happen between tickets. This ticket's own build runs on the old copy in `intake/harness/`, which has no lock, so it is not affected. Within this parent, the lock E writes is right at close only if no later sub-ticket changes harness code; if any later sub-ticket touches harness paths, it also rewrites `.factory/harness.lock` (E.3). The planner must not let a fix-up on harness paths merge after E without that.

**Part A size.** Part A is about 4,400 imported lines plus `uv.lock`: 2,557 lines of package, workflows and `bin/factory`, and 1,801 lines across 7 test `.py` files plus fixtures. That is far above the 400-line guideline, but it is a verbatim import. It is verified mechanically (history subjects, byte comparison of the role prompts, the suite) rather than by reading. Part A's own non-import diff is small: `pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`, and the interim overlay.

**Fragile acceptance anchor.** Items harness-history-carried and role-prompt-text-unchanged find green's pilot merge by its subject. If part A cuts later than G and green changes a role prompt in between, role-prompt-text-unchanged compares against the wrong revision. Check `git -C ~/dev/nanobot-upstream log G..feat/lionbot-v3 -- factory/prompts .claude/agents` (empty today, since G is green's HEAD).

**Protected paths touched** (instance B's current classes, declared for the gate):
- **infra `intake/**`**: `intake/README.md`, `setup.sh`, `HARNESS_PIN` and `instance/*` are removed. `intake/answers/` and `intake/green-pilot/` move out, byte-identical. `intake/state/**` and `intake/.gitignore` are not changed by the PRs; the post-close operator step moves them.
- **generated `prompts/**`**: moved to `docs/prompts/`, byte-identical.
- **reference_harness `~/dev/nanobot-upstream/**`**: read only. Part A clones it into a scratch directory; acceptance reads it with `git log`, `git show` and `git cat-file`.
- **credentials `~/.nanobot/**`**: not read or written.

**Guardrail paths touched:**
- **Agent prompts.** The six agent definitions move to `agents/`, and four of them get the new pointer line. The seven role prompts move to `factory/prompts/` byte-identical. The preamble becomes the design doc's block verbatim. The `prompts/` copies move to `docs/prompts/`.
- **Tests.** There are no existing tests in this repo. `tests/factory/**` arrives as new files, byte-identical to green's. New test files and the new `conftest.py` with its fixture instance are added. The conftest changes which config every imported test runs with: the fixed fixture instead of whatever instance surrounds the checkout.
- No CI config, `AGENTS.md` or skills exist here.

## Operator steps

1. **Optional, during the build, after part A merges.** Run `uv sync` in `~/dev/spec-factory`. Then append `uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory` to `gate_commands` in the running copy's `intake/harness/factory/config.yaml`, so that later sub-tickets are gated by the moved suite. That file is live, gitignored infra.
2. **After the parent closes**, with the store committed and no run in flight, move the live store:
   - `git mv intake/state .factory/state`.
   - In `.factory/instance.yaml`, set `state_dir: .factory/state` and drop `intake/**` from `protected_paths.infra`.
   - `git rm -q intake/.gitignore && rm -rf intake/harness`.
   - Move or delete anything still under `intake/` (untracked; today `intake/requests/19_harness_home.md`).
   - Create the runtime at the closing revision: `git worktree add --detach ~/dev/spec-factory-harness main && uv sync --frozen --project ~/dev/spec-factory-harness`. Its harness revision equals the lock E wrote (E.3).
   - Check: `~/dev/spec-factory-harness/bin/factory paths`, run from `~/dev/spec-factory`, shows `harness` = the runtime and `state` ending in `/.factory/state`, and the command of scenario instance-b-opens-every-ticket prints `tickets=N failed=0` with N ≥ 12.
   - Commit.
3. **End-to-end run.** Run the next ticket (#20 or #21) through the moved harness: take `intake_workflow` from `~/dev/spec-factory-harness/bin/factory paths`, and call the Workflow tool with `{ticket, repo: <abs ~/dev/spec-factory-harness>, instance: <abs ~/dev/spec-factory/.factory>, inlineRoles: true}`. This is the request's "the installed harness runs this repo's own `.factory/` end to end". It needs agent runs, so it is not an acceptance command.
4. **Bookkeeping.** Update the #19 row in `dev/issues.md` and close GitHub #19. Then open the paired instance-A ticket for the Driver session.

## Proposed change

There are six parts, A to F; this is the NEEDS-SPLIT seam list. Dependencies: A before B before C before E. D can land at any point. F comes after D. E comes after B, C and D. All paths are relative to `~/dev/spec-factory` unless they start with `~/`.

**A. Harness import, with history.** Part A's tip has the harness in this repo and its suite green. It makes no behaviour change.
1. Make a fresh scratch clone: `git clone --no-local --single-branch --branch feat/lionbot-v3 ~/dev/nanobot-upstream <scratch>/g`. Its tip must be at or after G. Never run `filter-repo` in `~/dev/nanobot-upstream`.
2. In the clone: `git filter-repo --path factory/ --path bin/factory --path tests/factory/ --path-glob '.claude/agents/factory-*' --path-rename .claude/agents/:agents/`.
3. On the sub-ticket branch: `git pull --no-rebase --allow-unrelated-histories --no-edit <scratch>/g HEAD`. No paths overlap.
4. Remove the three green-only files from the tree and replace them with an **interim overlay**, which is this repo's current instance files. Part B deletes it.
   - `factory/config.yaml` becomes `intake/instance/config.yaml`, with `state_dir: intake/state` (now relative to this repo's root) and `environment_files: ["uv.lock"]`. The suite needs the latter (Evidence).
   - `factory/prompts/context.md` becomes `intake/instance/context.md`.
   - `factory/prompts/preamble.md` becomes `intake/instance/preamble.md`.
   - Every other imported file stays byte-identical to green at the cut.
5. Add `pyproject.toml` with:
   - `[project] name = "spec-factory"`, `version = "0.0.0"`, `requires-python = ">=3.11"`, `dependencies = ["pyyaml>=6"]`;
   - `[dependency-groups] dev = ["pytest>=8"]`;
   - `[tool.uv] package = false`.
   `bin/factory` runs `python -m factory` from the checkout, so no build backend is needed. Run `uv lock` and commit `uv.lock`. Add a root `.gitignore` with `.venv/`, `__pycache__/` and `.pytest_cache/`.
6. Check: `uv sync --frozen && PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory` reports 70 passed.

**B. Instances: discovery, config, briefing, preamble, `init`, `paths`.**
1. **One instance resolver**, used by `store`, `gitops`, `compose` and `cli`:
   - If `FACTORY_INSTANCE` is set, it names the instance's `.factory/` directory.
   - Otherwise, walk up from the caller's working directory to the nearest directory that contains `.factory/instance.yaml`. `bin/factory` must hand the package the caller's working directory, since it changes into the harness checkout before running.
   - If nothing is found, exit 2 with stderr `no .factory/instance.yaml found from <cwd>; run factory init --repo-name NAME, or set FACTORY_INSTANCE`, and write nothing. There is no fallback to the harness checkout.
   - `init` and `paths` are exempt.
2. **Where things come from:**
   - Config is `<instance>/instance.yaml`. This replaces `store.CONFIG_PATH`; the keys are today's config keys plus `harness`.
   - The repo root is the parent of the instance directory, whatever that directory is named (`.factory/` when found by the walk-up; any directory when named by `FACTORY_INSTANCE`). `FACTORY_REPO` still overrides it.
   - `state_dir` is relative to the repo root. `FACTORY_STATE` still overrides it.
   - `FACTORY_INTEGRATION_BRANCH` is unchanged.
3. **Role-context block.** `run compose` opens `input.md` with `<instance>/context.md`. Delete `factory/prompts/context.md`.
4. **Preamble.** `factory/prompts/preamble.md` becomes the design doc's preamble block verbatim, byte-identical to `prompts/00-preamble.md` (later `docs/prompts/00-preamble.md`). `run start` writes `system-prompt.txt` with two substitutions:
   - `{repo name}` becomes the instance's `repo_name`.
   - The line `  {auth, payments, migrations, infra, public API, dependencies}` becomes two spaces followed by `<class> (<glob>, <glob>)` for each `protected_paths` entry, joined by `, `.
   The seven role prompt files do not change.
5. **`factory init [--repo-name NAME]`** works at the git top level of the working directory, and exits 2 outside a git work tree. It is idempotent and creates only what is missing:
   - `.factory/instance.yaml`, from a new `factory/instance.template.yaml`. It sets `repo_name`, `harness` (the absolute path of the running harness checkout), `state_dir: .factory/state`, `protected_paths: {infra: [".factory/instance.yaml", ".factory/harness.lock", ".factory/context.md"]}` and `gate_commands: []`. Today's generic values come with it: placeholders, `max_rounds`, `integration_branch: null`, `environment_files: []`, `force_push_allowed: false`, `models`, `ready_state`, `routing`. It needs `--repo-name`; without one, it exits 2.
   - `.factory/context.md`, from a new `factory/context.template.md`: a stub that says what the briefing must state.
   - `.factory/harness.lock`: the current harness revision (C).
   - The store at `state_dir`, with today's `init` content (the spec-store tree, `decisions.md`) and the store `.gitignore`.
   - `.claude/agents/factory-*.md`, copied from `agents/` for each missing file. When it writes any agent file, it prints `restart the session so the agents register`.
   After a fresh `init`, `.factory/` holds exactly `context.md`, `harness.lock`, `instance.yaml` and `state`. With an instance present and `--repo-name` omitted, it does today's `init` plus any missing pieces.
6. **`factory paths`** prints one JSON object with absolute paths: `harness`, `bin`, `intake_workflow`, `build_workflow`, `harness_revision` (C), `instance` and `state`. The last two are `null` when no instance is found. It runs no lock check and writes nothing.
7. **Agent templates.** In `agents/factory-{triage,spec-writer,spec-critic,planner}.md`, replace the line ``Read `factory/prompts/preamble.md` before anything else; it is the top of your system prompt.`` with ``Read `system-prompt.txt` in the run directory that holds your input file before anything else; its preamble is the top of your system prompt.`` Nothing else in `agents/` changes.
8. **Workflows.** `factory/workflows/intake.js` and `build.js` accept `instance`, the absolute path of the target's `.factory/`. When it is given, every store command is prefixed with `FACTORY_INSTANCE=<instance>`. `state` becomes optional (it still sets `FACTORY_STATE`), and `repo` stays the harness checkout. Update the header comments.
9. **Tests.**
   - Add a new `tests/factory/conftest.py` that, at import, sets `os.environ["FACTORY_INSTANCE"]` to a new fixture, `tests/factory/fixtures/instance/`, and sets `FACTORY_REPO` to the harness checkout (`Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]`) unless it is already set. Without the second line the repo root would be `tests/factory/fixtures/` (B.2); with it, every imported test sees the same repo root it sees today, and the shepherd tests, which set `FACTORY_REPO` to their own throwaway repo in each subprocess environment, still override it. The fixture has `instance.yaml` with the template values plus `environment_files: ["uv.lock"]` and `gate_commands: ["git diff --check main...HEAD"]`, and a `context.md`. Every existing test already builds its subprocess environment from `os.environ`.
   - Add new test files for B's behaviours.
   - Delete A's interim `factory/config.yaml`. Its `prompts/context.md` was deleted in item 3.

**C. Harness revision and lock.**
1. The **harness revision** is `git -C <harness> log -1 --format=%H -- factory bin/factory agents pyproject.toml uv.lock`.
2. **When the store in use is the instance's own store** (`FACTORY_STATE` is unset or resolves to the instance's `state_dir`), every command except `init` and `paths` first compares the stripped first line of `<instance>/harness.lock` with the revision. If they differ, or the lock is missing, the command exits 2 with stderr `harness <rev> is not the revision this instance accepted (<lock>|none); rerun with --accept-harness <rev> to accept it`, and writes nothing. Other stores are not checked.
3. **`--accept-harness SHA`** is a global option, written before the subcommand.
   - The SHA must equal the current revision, as 40 hex characters. Otherwise the command exits 2 and leaves the lock unchanged.
   - If it matches, the harness writes the SHA to `harness.lock` and appends a log event to the instance's store recording the old and new revisions, then runs the command.
4. **Uncommitted harness edits are refused** under the same condition as item 2. If `git -C <harness> status --porcelain -- factory bin/factory agents pyproject.toml uv.lock` prints anything (files `.gitignore` excludes do not count), the command exits 2, writes nothing, and its stderr says `harness <path> has uncommitted changes:` followed by the changed paths, one per line. `--accept-harness` does not override this: the edit is committed or discarded first. Like item 2, it applies only to the instance's own store, so a harness under development, which is uncommitted by definition, still runs its own tests against throwaway stores.
5. Add new test files for C.

**D. Document re-layout.** Content is unchanged apart from the path updates.
1. `git mv docs/spec-factory.md docs/design.md`. Then move its `## Changelog` section, from the heading to the line before `## Appendix`, into a new `docs/changelog.md`: a `# Changelog` title, then that text verbatim (intro paragraph, numbered entries, `Declined:` line). At the end of "How to use this" in `docs/design.md`, add one line naming `docs/changelog.md` and `docs/prompts/`.
2. `git mv prompts docs/prompts`. The bytes do not change.
3. `git mv specs/build-harness.md dev/build-harness.spec.md`, `git mv plans/build-harness.md dev/build-harness.plan.md`, `git mv plans/P0-intake-skeleton.md dev/P0-intake-skeleton.md`, `git mv issues/README.md dev/issues.md`.
4. Update the references in:
   - `README.md` (until E rewrites it);
   - `dev/build-harness.plan.md` (the nine `Parent:` lines);
   - `dev/P0-intake-skeleton.md:3`;
   - `intake/README.md` and `intake/instance/context.md` (while they still exist).
   Records are left as written: `intake/answers/`, the stores, and changelog entries.

**E. Instance B cutover.** The live store does not move in this part.
1. `.factory/instance.yaml` starts from `intake/instance/config.yaml`, with these changes:
   - `repo_name: "spec-factory (the design repo at ~/dev/spec-factory, branch main)"`, `harness: <absolute path of ~/dev/spec-factory-harness>` (the runtime; the Decisions entry on two checkouts) and `state_dir: intake/state`.
   - `protected_paths`: `infra: [".factory/**", "intake/**"]`, `harness: ["factory/**", "bin/factory", "agents/**", "pyproject.toml", "uv.lock"]`, `generated: ["docs/prompts/**"]`, `reference_harness: ["~/dev/nanobot-upstream/**"]`, `credentials: ["~/.nanobot/**"]`.
   - `gate_commands: ["git diff --check main...HEAD", "uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory"]` and `environment_files: []`. `uv.lock` is tracked here, and copying it in would mask a branch's own lock.
   - `request_dir` is dropped: no harness code reads it, and its value (`../../issues`) is relative to the old `intake/harness/` copy and names a directory D removes.
   - Every other key is unchanged.
2. `.factory/context.md` is `intake/instance/context.md` rewritten for the new layout. It names:
   - `docs/design.md` (source of truth) and `docs/changelog.md`;
   - `docs/prompts/` (verbatim copies, changed only by re-copying);
   - `dev/` (working documents for building the factory);
   - the harness as code in this repo (`factory/`, `bin/factory`, `agents/`, `tests/factory/`, run with `uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory`);
   - the two checkouts: tickets merge into the dev checkout (`~/dev/spec-factory`, `main`); the factory runs from the runtime (`~/dev/spec-factory-harness`), moved only by the upgrade step;
   - green as instance A, read only.
   It keeps the existing rules on acceptance commands and design-doc conventions, with the paths updated.
3. `.factory/harness.lock` holds the harness revision (C.1) at E's base. Any sub-ticket that touches `factory/`, `bin/factory`, `agents/`, `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock` and merges after E branches also rewrites `.factory/harness.lock` to the new revision; otherwise instance B refuses its own store at close.
4. `.factory/README.md` carries the still-true parts of `intake/README.md`: the ticket to GitHub-issue table, how to run, and scope, written as "this repo's own instance".
5. Remove `intake/README.md`, `intake/setup.sh`, `intake/HARNESS_PIN` and `intake/instance/*`. Move `intake/answers/` to `.factory/answers/`, byte-identical. Move `intake/green-pilot/` out of `intake/`, byte-identical, to a place the planner chooses: a second instance directory or a folded-in archive. Keep `intake/state/` and `intake/.gitignore`.
6. Rewrite `README.md`:
   - what the factory is;
   - install (`git clone`, `uv sync`);
   - five-minute use: `factory init --repo-name`, restart the session, fill in `.factory/context.md` and `gate_commands`, `factory paths`, the Workflow call with `scriptPath` and `{ticket, repo, instance}`, and `approve-spec`;
   - where things live: `docs/design.md`, `docs/changelog.md`, `docs/prompts/`, `dev/`, `factory/`, `bin/factory`, `agents/`, `tests/factory/`, `.factory/`;
   - how updates work: a target holds no harness code, only `.factory/`, and runs whatever revision the runtime checkout it names has checked out. The lock makes a new revision available rather than silently adopted: each target refuses an unaccepted revision, and refuses uncommitted harness edits, until `--accept-harness`. Develop the harness in one checkout and run targets from a separate runtime checkout, so a merge never changes code under a running ticket; upgrading is moving the runtime, then accepting per target.

**F. Design-doc and build-spec text.**
1. **`docs/design.md`, §Harness, "Role-context block" paragraph.** Replace its last sentence ("Where the block is kept, and how a harness serving more than one repo picks the right one, are not fixed here.") with:
   "The block is kept in the repo it describes, at `.factory/context.md`. That directory, `.factory/`, is the repo's instance of the factory: `instance.yaml` (the per-repo config: `{repo name}`, protected paths, `{gate commands}`, models, routing, the store's path and the harness checkout it runs with), `context.md`, `harness.lock` (the harness revision the instance has accepted; the harness refuses to touch the instance's store under any other revision until a human accepts it, and logs the acceptance) and the store. The harness picks the instance by walking up from the working directory to the nearest `.factory/instance.yaml`, or takes it from an explicit override, and never falls back to an instance of its own; the composer prepends that instance's `context.md`, and the preamble's `{repo name}` and protected paths are filled from its `instance.yaml`."
2. **`docs/design.md`, piece 8 row ("Guardrail and protected paths"), "What it must do" cell.** Append: "The harness code (its package, entry point, agent templates and dependency lock) is itself a protected path in the repo that holds it."
3. **`docs/changelog.md`.** Append one entry, numbered one past the last entry at merge time (42 today):
   "After issue #19 (2026-10-02): the harness lives in this repo and each target repo carries a `.factory/` instance: `instance.yaml`, `context.md` (the role-context block, prepended by the composer), `harness.lock` (the accepted harness revision; any other revision is refused until a human accepts it) and the store. The harness finds the instance by walking up from the working directory, and its own code is a protected path in the repo that holds it. The design doc splits into `docs/design.md` and this changelog, the prompt copies move to `docs/prompts/`, and the working documents for building the factory move to `dev/`."
4. **`dev/build-harness.spec.md`.**
   - D8 row, Value column: "per instance: `repo_name` and `protected_paths` in the target repo's `.factory/instance.yaml` (doc §Harness, role-context block); for nanobot: `nanobot`; protected: `infra`, `dependencies`, `credentials`, `public API` (globs in F)".
   - Layout row `factory/prompts/design-doc.md`: becomes `docs/design.md (spec-factory, beside the harness)  the design doc; the only doc `factory render` reads (A)`.
   - Part A's `factory render` bullet: it reads `docs/design.md`, which is in the same repo as the harness, and still has no `--doc` option. It writes `docs/prompts/` and the `agents/` templates from the blocks. The placeholders are filled per instance from `.factory/instance.yaml` when a run starts, and `render --check` diffs against `docs/design.md`.
   - Item 82: every `factory/prompts/design-doc.md` becomes `docs/design.md`.
   - Leave the `## Responses` history as written.

Size per part:
- A: import plus about 40 lines of its own.
- B: about 300 lines including new tests.
- C: about 120.
- D: renames plus about 30.
- E: about 150 plus renames.
- F: about 15.

## Tests to change

none. This repo has no existing tests. `tests/factory/**` arrives byte-identical. The new `conftest.py`, the fixture instance and the new test files are new files. See Risk for the conftest's effect on the imported tests.

=== specs/harness-home/spec.md
## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: harness-code-lives-in-design-repo
The harness package, its entry point, its two workflow scripts, its test suite and the six agent definition templates MUST be tracked in this repository, and green's repo-specific config and briefing MUST NOT be.

#### Scenario: harness-files-in-repo
- WHEN `for p in factory/cli.py factory/store.py factory/compose.py factory/gitops.py factory/workflows/intake.js factory/workflows/build.js bin/factory pyproject.toml uv.lock tests/factory/test_p0_cli.py; do test -e "$p" || echo "missing $p"; done; echo "agents=$(ls agents/factory-*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ') green_only=$(ls factory/config.yaml factory/prompts/context.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"`
- THEN it prints only `agents=6 green_only=0`

### Requirement: harness-history-carried
Every non-merge commit of green, up to its latest pilot merge, that touched the harness package code, workflows, entry point, tests or factory agent definitions SHALL appear in this repository's history with the same subject.

#### Scenario: harness-history-carried
- WHEN `G=$(git -C ~/dev/nanobot-upstream log -1 --format=%H --grep='^Merge factory/T-0002.1' feat/lionbot-v3); comm -23 <(git -C ~/dev/nanobot-upstream log --no-merges --format=%s "$G" -- 'factory/*.py' factory/workflows bin/factory tests/factory '.claude/agents/factory-*' | sort -u) <(git log --no-merges --format=%s -- 'factory/*.py' factory/workflows bin/factory tests/factory 'agents/factory-*' | sort -u) | wc -l | tr -d ' '`
- THEN it prints `0`

### Requirement: harness-installs-with-uv
`uv sync` in a checkout of this repository SHALL give the harness its interpreter and dependencies, and the moved test suite MUST pass there.

#### Scenario: harness-suite-passes-after-uv-sync
- WHEN `uv sync --frozen -q >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "sync=$?"; PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory 2>&1 | tail -1`
- THEN it prints `sync=0`, then a line `N passed in …` with N ≥ 70 and no `failed` or `error`

### Requirement: role-prompt-text-unchanged
The role prompts and agent definitions MUST move without any change to their wording: the agent templates differ from green's only in the preamble pointer line, the seven role prompts are byte-identical to green's, and the harness's preamble is byte-identical to the design doc's copy.

#### Scenario: role-prompt-text-unchanged
- WHEN `G=$(git -C ~/dev/nanobot-upstream log -1 --format=%H --grep='^Merge factory/T-0002.1' feat/lionbot-v3); c=0; n=0; for f in factory-clerk factory-planner factory-spec-critic factory-spec-writer factory-stub factory-triage; do n=$((n+1)); cmp -s <(git -C ~/dev/nanobot-upstream show "$G:.claude/agents/$f.md" | grep -v 'before anything else') <(grep -v 'before anything else' "agents/$f.md" 2>/dev/null) || c=$((c+1)); done; for f in triage spec_writer critic planner implementer reviewer verifier; do n=$((n+1)); cmp -s <(git -C ~/dev/nanobot-upstream show "$G:factory/prompts/$f.md") "factory/prompts/$f.md" || c=$((c+1)); done; n=$((n+1)); cmp -s factory/prompts/preamble.md docs/prompts/00-preamble.md || c=$((c+1)); echo "changed=$c of $n"`
- THEN it prints `changed=0 of 14`

=== specs/factory-instance/spec.md
## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: instance-created-by-init
`factory init --repo-name NAME`, run anywhere inside a git work tree with no instance, SHALL create `.factory/` at that tree's top level holding `instance.yaml`, `context.md`, `harness.lock` and the store, SHALL copy the six agent definitions into `.claude/agents/`, and SHALL tell the operator to restart the session.

#### Scenario: init-creates-instance-in-throwaway-target
- WHEN `H=$PWD; T=$(mktemp -d); git -C $T init -q -b main && git -C $T -c user.name=t -c user.email=t@t commit -q --allow-empty -m init && mkdir $T/sub && cd $T/sub && $H/bin/factory init --repo-name demo >$T/init.out 2>&1; echo "init=$?"; printf '# demo\n\nDo the thing.\n' > $T/r.md; echo "instance=[$(ls -A $T/.factory 2>/dev/null | tr '\n' ' ')] agents=$(ls $T/.claude/agents/factory-*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ') restart=$(grep -c 'restart the session' $T/init.out)"`
- THEN it prints `init=0` then `instance=[context.md harness.lock instance.yaml state ] agents=6 restart=1`

#### Scenario: store-command-from-subdirectory-uses-target-instance
- WHEN `H=$PWD; T=$(mktemp -d); git -C $T init -q -b main && git -C $T -c user.name=t -c user.email=t@t commit -q --allow-empty -m init && mkdir $T/sub && cd $T/sub && $H/bin/factory init --repo-name demo >$T/init.out 2>&1; echo "init=$?"; printf '# demo\n\nDo the thing.\n' > $T/r.md; before=$(git -C $H status --porcelain | wc -l); $H/bin/factory ticket new --file $T/r.md >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "new=$? tickets=[$(ls $T/.factory/state/tickets 2>/dev/null)] harness_changes=$(( $(git -C $H status --porcelain | wc -l) - before ))"`
- THEN it prints `init=0` then `new=0 tickets=[T-0001.yaml] harness_changes=0`

### Requirement: no-instance-refused
A store command run where no instance is found and no override is set MUST be refused with exit 2, an error naming `instance.yaml`, and nothing written.

#### Scenario: command-outside-any-instance-refused
- WHEN `H=$PWD; D=$(mktemp -d); cd $D && $H/bin/factory ticket show T-0001 >$D/out 2>$D/err; echo "exit=$? created=$(ls -A $D | grep -v -x -e out -e err | wc -l | tr -d ' ') names_instance=$(grep -c 'instance.yaml' $D/err)"`
- THEN it prints `exit=2 created=0 names_instance=1`

### Requirement: instance-override
`FACTORY_INSTANCE` SHALL select the instance regardless of the working directory.

#### Scenario: factory-instance-override-from-elsewhere
- WHEN `H=$PWD; T=$(mktemp -d); git -C $T init -q -b main && git -C $T -c user.name=t -c user.email=t@t commit -q --allow-empty -m init && mkdir $T/sub && cd $T/sub && $H/bin/factory init --repo-name demo >$T/init.out 2>&1; echo "init=$?"; printf '# demo\n\nDo the thing.\n' > $T/r.md; $H/bin/factory ticket new --file $T/r.md >/dev/null 2>&1; D=$(mktemp -d); cd $D && echo "found=$(FACTORY_INSTANCE=$T/.factory $H/bin/factory ticket show T-0001 2>/dev/null | grep -c '^title: demo$')"`
- THEN it prints `init=0` then `found=1`

### Requirement: compose-prepends-instance-context

## Acceptance

Run every command with bash from the root of the `~/dev/spec-factory` checkout under test, which at parent close is `main`. `~/dev/nanobot-upstream` and `uv` must be on the machine. "Today" means `main` at `f082708`, with `BASE=$(git rev-parse main)`. Every today output below was observed on this checkout. The expected results for B and C are design targets; no code for them exists yet.

- harness-files-in-repo → NEW. Today it prints ten `missing …` lines (from `factory/cli.py` to `tests/factory/test_p0_cli.py`), then `agents=0 green_only=0`.
- harness-history-carried → NEW. Today it prints `24`, because none of green's harness commits are here. In the scratch import trial it printed `0`.
- harness-suite-passes-after-uv-sync → NEW. Today `uv sync` fails (`No pyproject.toml found`) and it prints `sync=2`, then `no tests ran in 0.00s`. Green's suite gave `70 passed` in a scratch copy.
- role-prompt-text-unchanged → NEW. Today it prints `changed=14 of 14`, because none of the files exist here. After the import trial it printed `changed=1 of 14`; the one is the preamble, which part B replaces.
- init-creates-instance-in-throwaway-target → NEW. Today it prints `init=127` (`bin/factory` does not exist), then `instance=[] agents=0 restart=0`.
- store-command-from-subdirectory-uses-target-instance → NEW. Today it prints `init=127`, then `new=127 tickets=[] harness_changes=0`.
- command-outside-any-instance-refused → NEW. Today it prints `exit=127 created=0 names_instance=0`.
- factory-instance-override-from-elsewhere → NEW. Today it prints `init=127`, then `found=0`.
- composed-input-opens-with-instance-context → NEW. Today it prints `init=127`, then `first=[]`.
- run-system-prompt-names-instance → NEW. Today it prints `init=127`, then `line1=[] placeholders= protects_instance=`.
- paths-name-harness-workflows-and-instance → NEW. Today it prints `init=127`, then `no paths`.
- lock-mismatch-refused → NEW. Today it prints `init=127`, then `exit=127 tickets=0 hint=0`.
- accept-current-revision-rewrites-lock → NEW. Today it prints `init=127`, then `exit=127 lock_is_rev=no logged=0`.
- accept-other-revision-refused → NEW. Today it prints `init=127`, then `exit=127 lock= tickets=0`.
- throwaway-store-ignores-lock → NEW. Today it prints `init=127`, then `exit=127 ticket=[]`.
- dirty-harness-refused → NEW (added at the gate; not run there). Today `bin/factory` does not exist in the clone, so it is expected to print `init=127`, then `exit=127 tickets=0 names=0`.
- docs-moved-and-split → NEW. Today it prints seven `missing …` lines, then `old_tracked=15`. In the scratch split trial it printed `old_tracked=0`.
- changelog-moved-verbatim → NEW. Today it prints `DIFFERENT`, then `declined= numbering=NONE in_design=`. In the trial it printed `SAME`, then `declined=1 numbering=CONTIGUOUS in_design=0`.
- design-text-kept → NEW. Today it prints `570`, because `docs/design.md` does not exist. In the trial it printed `0`.
- prompt-copies-moved-unchanged → NEW. Today it prints `changed=10 of 10 DRIFT`. In the trial it printed `changed=0 of 10 VERBATIM`.
- no-old-paths-in-live-files → NEW. Today it prints `exit=0`: `README.md` lines 5, 6, 9 and 11 match.
- readme-has-install-and-layout → NEW. Today it prints seven `missing: …` lines, then `checked`.
- design-doc-instance-text → NEW. Today it prints `kept=0 open= piece8=0 logged=0`.
- build-spec-render-paths → NEW. Today it prints `stale=0 new= d8=0`, because the file is not at `dev/`. The `stale=0` there is vacuous: `awk` read no file.
- intake-holds-only-live-store → NEW. Today it prints `left=167`.
- pilot-store-and-answers-kept-byte-identical → NEW. Today it prints `kept=0 of 134`, because every one of those files is tracked only under `intake/`.
- instance-b-opens-every-ticket → NEW. Today it prints `tickets=0 failed=0`, because `bin/factory` does not exist here and no store is found. The same tickets open today through the old copy: `FACTORY_STATE=$PWD/intake/state intake/harness/bin/factory ticket show T-000N` succeeds for all twelve.
- instance-b-config → NEW. Today it prints `no instance config`, then `context=`.
- green-harness-still-present → REGRESSION. It prints `green keeps its harness` today and must still do so after the change.
- whitespace-clean → REGRESSION. It prints `exit=0` today (an empty range) and must still do so over the whole parent.

How verified:
- I ran every WHEN above verbatim on this checkout for the "today" results.
- The A and D results marked "trial" came from a scratch clone of this repo:
  - for A, with green's harness imported by `git filter-repo` from a scratch clone of green;
  - for D, with the document moves done by `git mv` plus an `awk` split of the Changelog.
- Green's suite was run in a scratch `git archive` copy with green's venv, three times: with green's config, with this repo's config, and with this repo's config plus `environment_files: ["uv.lock"]`.
- Nothing was written in `~/dev/nanobot-upstream`.
- I did not build B, C, E or F. Their scenarios are checked against today's failure only, and their expected results are the design above.
- Round 2: `main` is still `f082708` and green is still at G (`git rev-parse main`; `git -C ~/dev/nanobot-upstream log -1 --format='%h %s' feat/lionbot-v3`). I re-ran harness-history-carried (`24`), intake-holds-only-live-store (`left=167`), pilot-store-and-answers-kept-byte-identical (`kept=0 of 134`), no-old-paths-in-live-files (matches on `README.md` lines 5, 6, 9, 11) and whitespace-clean (`exit=0`), and `git -C ~/dev/nanobot-upstream log G..feat/lionbot-v3 -- factory/prompts .claude/agents` (empty). No acceptance item changed in this round.

## Responses

- [BLOCKING] Problem, first paragraph → FIXED. A new second paragraph says it outright: the harness can serve only the repo it lives in; the operator who runs it on this repo keeps a hand-made copy that drifts, and every new project would have to make the same copy. The later "This affects two groups" list stays as the summary.
- [SHOULD-FIX] design.md B.2, repo root with `FACTORY_INSTANCE` → FIXED. B.2 now says the repo root is the parent of the instance directory, whatever it is named, with `FACTORY_REPO` still overriding. Following that rule, the fixture instance would make the repo root `tests/factory/fixtures/`. `compose` reads the repo root too (Evidence), and every imported test except the shepherd ones relies on the default. So B.9's conftest now also sets `FACTORY_REPO` to the harness checkout when it is unset, which is exactly today's default. The shepherd tests still set their own `FACTORY_REPO` per subprocess. Added under Decisions.
- [NIT] E.1 carries `request_dir` → FIXED. E.1 drops the key, with the reason, and Decisions says so. Checked: `grep -rn request_dir factory/*.py factory/workflows/` on green prints nothing. The key is on line 6 of `intake/instance/config.yaml`, not line 3.
- [NIT] lock at parent close depends on no later harness-path merge → FIXED. E.3 now says any sub-ticket that touches harness paths and merges after E branches also rewrites `.factory/harness.lock`. Risk ("Lock behaviour after close") repeats it for the planner.

Out-of-scope observations:
- `main` moved twice during this run, to `b722abd` (#20 filed, "after #19") and then `f082708` (#13 and #14 "fold in" to #21, "after #19"). Neither touched the files this spec changes, except `issues/README.md` gaining rows. Part D moves that file as-is.
- `intake/requests/19_harness_home.md` (this request's file) is untracked. The post-close operator step has to move or delete it.
- The store's run records (`meta.yaml`, `input.md`) hold absolute `intake/state/...` paths. After the post-close move they stay as historical text and no command reads them back.
- `factory init` now has a third meaning in the build spec: part A's bare-repo seeding (`dev/build-harness.spec.md`, "factory init: creates ~/factory-remote/nanobot.git"). Part F does not reconcile it. A later build-spec pass should.
- Even after this change there are three prompt texts: `docs/design.md`, `docs/prompts/` (verbatim), and `factory/prompts/<role>.md` (placeholders filled, plus the spec-writer and triage addendum). With all three in one repo a `render --check` becomes possible, but it is not built here.

Branch: `factory/T-0012.5` in `/Users/dphang/dev/spec-factory/intake/state/worktrees/T-0012.5`, base `bed7e2883d86583731c111036fde925fa513d34d`, head `7090d9d21f17688df45fd3701dc5ee26f01452c4` (one commit). `git diff --stat main...HEAD`: `dev/build-harness.spec.md | 8`, `docs/changelog.md | 1`, `docs/design.md | 4`; 3 files, 7 insertions, 6 deletions.

## What changed

- **F.1, `docs/design.md` "Role-context block" paragraph (line 54).** I replaced the last sentence, "Where the block is kept, and how a harness serving more than one repo picks the right one, are not fixed here.", with the parent's F.1 text word for word: the block lives at `.factory/context.md`, what the instance holds, how the harness finds the instance by walking up or by override with no fallback, and the composer and preamble filling.
- **F.2, `docs/design.md` piece 8 row (line 46), "What it must do" cell.** I appended "The harness code (its package, entry point, agent templates and dependency lock) is itself a protected path in the repo that holds it." The cell used to end "…needs a human approval on the PR itself" with no full stop, so I added one before the new sentence. That full stop is the only character I changed outside the parent's text, and it is on the line that design-text-kept excludes.
- **F.3, `docs/changelog.md`.** I added entry `42. After issue #19 (2026-10-02): …`, using the parent's F.3 text word for word. It sits right after entry 41 and before the `Declined:` line, so the numbered list stays together. 42 is one past main's last entry: `git show main:docs/changelog.md | grep -c '^[0-9][0-9]*\. '` printed 41.
- **F.4, `dev/build-harness.spec.md`:**
  - **D8 row, Value column.** It now reads "per instance: `repo_name` and `protected_paths` in the target repo's `.factory/instance.yaml` (doc §Harness, role-context block); for nanobot: `nanobot`; protected: `infra`, `dependencies`, `credentials`, `public API` (globs in F)".
  - **Layout row (line 145).** It is now `docs/design.md (spec-factory, beside the harness)  the design doc; the only doc `factory render` reads (A)`, exactly as F.4 gives it.
  - **Part A `factory render` bullet (line 158):**
    - It now says that render reads `docs/design.md`, which is in the same repo as the harness, reads no other path and still has no `--doc` option.
    - It writes `docs/prompts/` and the `agents/` templates from the prompt blocks.
    - The addendum-2 added rule is kept as it was.
    - New sentence: the placeholders (`{repo name}`, protected paths, `{2}`, `{400}`, `{gate commands}`, `{3}`, `{5}`, `{force-push allowed}`) are filled per instance from `.factory/instance.yaml` when a run starts.
    - `render --check` now diffs against `docs/design.md`.
    - Removed: "writes `factory/prompts/preamble.md` and the eight `.claude/agents/factory-<role>.md` bodies", "under the guardrail glob `factory/prompts/**`" and "filled from `config.yaml`". F.4 replaces each of them.
  - **Item 82 (line 456).** All three `factory/prompts/design-doc.md` there became `docs/design.md`. Nothing else on that line changed.
  - **`## Responses`.** Not touched. Its line 537 still says `factory/prompts/design-doc.md`, as the ticket requires.

No `docs/prompts/` file changed: neither line I rewrote in `docs/design.md` is inside a prompt block.

## Acceptance results

Every command below was run from the worktree with `BASE=cdb1c6769ecc39208e62edc65578f62f5a23908f`, the parent's recorded base (`parent_base` in `intake/state/tickets/T-0012.yaml`). The commands are the parent spec's WHEN lines and the sub-ticket's intermediates, copied verbatim.

| Criterion | Before (base `bed7e28`) | After (`7090d9d`) |
|---|---|---|
| design-doc-instance-text (NEW) | `kept=0 open=1 piece8=0 logged=0` | `kept=1 open=0 piece8=1 logged=1` |
| build-spec-render-paths (NEW) | `stale=3 new=0 d8=0` | `stale=0 new=3 d8=1` (N=3 ≥ 3) |
| changelog-entry-appended (NEW, F.3) | `0` | `1` |
| responses-unchanged (NEW, F.4) | `exit=0` | `exit=0` |
| changelog-moved-verbatim (REGRESSION) | `SAME` / `declined=1 numbering=CONTIGUOUS in_design=0` | `SAME` / `declined=1 numbering=CONTIGUOUS in_design=0` |
| design-text-kept (REGRESSION) | `0` | `0` |
| prompt-copies-moved-unchanged (REGRESSION) | `changed=0 of 10 VERBATIM` | `changed=0 of 10 VERBATIM` |
| no-old-paths, documents only (REGRESSION; T-0012.2's command) | `exit=1` | `exit=1` |
| whitespace, `git diff --check main...HEAD` (REGRESSION) | `exit=0` | `exit=0` |

Notes on the results:
- **responses-unchanged already printed `exit=0` before the change.** It is labelled NEW but it is a preservation check: it compares the section against `main`, so it passes trivially before any edit. Its value is that it still passes after the edit, and it does.
- **The three stale hits before the change were lines 145, 158 and 456**, the ones the sub-ticket names. After the change, `grep -n 'factory/prompts/design-doc\.md' dev/build-harness.spec.md` finds only line 537, which is inside `## Responses`.
- **Extra check.** `diff <(git show main:docs/design.md) docs/design.md | grep -c '^[<>]'` printed `4`: two lines out, two lines in. Those are the only two lines this sub-ticket rewrites.

Gates (run from the worktree, exactly as written):
- `git diff --check main...HEAD` printed nothing (exit 0).
- `uv run --frozen pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/factory` printed `92 passed in 93.75s (0:01:33)`.
  - The first `uv run` created the worktree's `.venv`, which `.gitignore` ignores (`git status --short` is empty).
  - uv warned that the inherited `VIRTUAL_ENV` (`/Users/dphang/dev/nanobot/.venv-test`) does not match the project environment and would be ignored. So the suite ran with the worktree's own `.venv`.

## Tests added/changed

None. This sub-ticket changes prose only, and "Tests to change" is none. The acceptance commands above are the checks for it.

## Known gaps and uncertainties

- **Full stop added to the piece 8 cell.** "itself" became "itself." so that the appended sentence reads as a separate sentence. F.2 says only "Append". If the gate wants the cell otherwise byte-identical, the alternative is "…on the PR itself; the harness code…", but that departs from F.2's wording instead.
- **Placement of changelog entry 42.** I put it after entry 41 and before the `Declined:` line, not after `Declined:` at the end of the file. "Append one entry" leaves this open. This placement keeps the numbered list together, and changelog-moved-verbatim still passes.
- **What the render bullet dropped.** It no longer says that render writes `factory/prompts/preamble.md` or fills placeholders from `config.yaml`, because F.4 says render writes `docs/prompts/` and the `agents/` templates and that placeholders are filled when a run starts. I did not keep the old "guardrail glob `factory/prompts/**`" wording, and I did not claim that `docs/design.md` is a guardrail path, because nothing in the parent says it is.
- **The commit was made with `git -c core.hooksPath=/dev/null`.** No hook was skipped: `core.hooksPath` is unset and the repo's hooks directory holds only `.sample` files. I checked this after the commit.
- **Not done by me:** a fresh reviewer's reading of the prose. I checked it only with the acceptance commands and by reading the word diff.

## Out-of-scope observations

- **The build spec still describes the old layout in places this ticket does not cover:**
  - The layout row `factory/prompts/preamble.md  doc §Shared preamble, placeholders filled (A)` (around line 140).
  - Item 82's `git status --porcelain .claude factory/prompts` and `.claude/agents/factory-verifier.md`.
  - The `AGENTS.md` bullet naming `factory/prompts/**` as a guardrail path.
  - D6's `factory/config.yaml`.
  - The bare-repo `factory init` (the parent's own out-of-scope observation).
  F.4 does not list any of these. A later build-spec pass should reconcile them.
- **Possible ambiguity on the input's single-output-file rule.** The context block says the output file is "the only file you may create or modify". As Implementer, I also edited the three files in my worktree and committed on `factory/T-0012.5`, which is what the role and "Where you work" require. I have not listed this under ESCALATIONS. I read that line as covering files outside my assigned worktree and branch.

STATUS: READY-FOR-REVIEW
CONFIDENCE: high. Every NEW criterion moved from failing to its target, every REGRESSION criterion and both gates pass, and the diff is limited to the 3 permitted files.
ESCALATIONS: none

 39. Specs live in an OpenSpec tree under a forked `spec-factory` schema (Harness, Spec store): current truth per capability, one change folder per ticket (proposal, design, delta, tasks, and the factory-only `verification.md`), and a repo-level `decisions.md`. The spec writer's FORMAT is one document in those parts, and the delta's scenarios are the Acceptance items; the spec writer and the critic receive current truth; the planner's output is the change's `tasks.md`; the spec gate pins the change folder; parent close archives it (apply the deltas, move the folder, append the decisions). Roles, round limits, gates and harness pieces 1–12 are unchanged.
 40. After the pilot specs on Nanobot green (2026-10-01): archive has two more refusals, no change folder (a spec pinned before the repo had an `openspec/` tree) and no spec store. Each parks the parent like a delta that does not apply, but the human closes that parent as applied: current truth and `decisions.md` are not updated, and the spec is re-intaken as a new ticket if current truth should carry it.
 41. After the T-0010 spec gate (2026-10-02), where the operator could not read an approved Problem section without a translation: the spec writer writes the Problem section in plain words for the operator who approves the spec at the gate, a deeply technical reader new to this system's internals, with each term of art specific to this system glossed on first use and the detail left to Evidence and Root cause; critic rubric 6 reads the Problem as that operator, and a first paragraph that does not say what is wrong and for whom, or uses an unglossed term specific to this system (even one a careful reader could infer), is BLOCKING.
+42. After issue #19 (2026-10-02): the harness lives in this repo and each target repo carries a `.factory/` instance: `instance.yaml`, `context.md` (the role-context block, prepended by the composer), `harness.lock` (the accepted harness revision; any other revision is refused until a human accepts it) and the store. The harness finds the instance by walking up from the working directory, and its own code is a protected path in the repo that holds it. The design doc splits into `docs/design.md` and this changelog, the prompt copies move to `docs/prompts/`, and the working documents for building the factory move to `dev/`.
 
 Declined: a dedicated merge agent (merging is gate config plus human gates, not a judgment call).

 | 5 | Change proposal | A unit of review: a branch, its base, its head commit, and a place for the PR description and findings. Approvals attach to the head commit.

GitLab MRs or Gerrit changes are direct equivalents |
 | 6 | Commit-bound results | Reviewer, verifier, and CI results are stored against a specific head SHA. A new push makes prior results stale; a result arriving for a head that is no longer current is discarded | Check runs and commit statuses; required checks re-run on push | A `results` table keyed by `(head_sha, role)`.

A bug in a prompt cannot bypass this. One exception, stated here and nowhere else, for two kinds of PR with no sub-ticket: a retro PR whose diff touches only non-test guardrail paths, and a human-authored revert whose diff the gate verifies is exactly the inverse of one merged change proposal's diff (main before that merge against main after it, both recorded in the store at merge time). Either merges on CI green, head contains main, and a human approval on that head recorded under the guardrail-changes gate; the human reads the whole diff, which stands in for APPROVE and VERIFIED. A no-sub-ticket PR that fails this test is closed and logged to the human queue | Branch protection with required checks and required reviews. Required checks cannot be waived per PR, so the exception needs a harness-emitted check that reports success for exception PRs | A server-side pre-receive hook on main that checks the results table, or a single merge bot that alone can write to main and checks the conditions before fast-forwarding. Either works; the hook is stricter |

 | 9 | Human surface | Where people approve specs, answer escalations, review protected PRs, reply to requesters, and read the weekly audit sample. Every decision writes back to the store as a record: who, when, which spec version or head SHA | Issue comments, PR reviews, approvals | The tracker's UI plus notifications (Slack, email) with links. The approval must be a stored, attributable record the merge gate can check, not a chat message |
 | 10 | Audit log | Every transition, every agent output, every human decision, append-only. The weekly audit and the retro read from here | Issue and PR timelines, Actions logs | An append-only table or log stream. Store full agent outputs as artifacts keyed by run id. If it isn't logged, the retro can't see it |
 | 11 | Gate runner | Runs `{gate commands}` (build, lint, typecheck, tests) on a head SHA and records PASS/FAIL against it (piece 6) | Actions CI | Any CI. Without one, the verifier runs the gates as step 4 of its prompt, and its "Gate suite" line is recorded as the CI result. Separate CI is better because it isn't an agent |

 **What the harness itself owns** (no platform provides these): the routing table, the round counter and the max-round cutoff, composing each role's input from *only* its declared sources, choosing the model per role, and the escalation queue view for the daily human pass.
 
-**Role-context block.** Every role's input opens with a role-context block, ahead of the INPUT its role prompt declares and anything the routing table's "Receives" column adds. The block is per repo, like `{repo name}` and the protected paths: it says which repository the role works in, how to run commands and tests there, and what kind of request to expect. Its text is the same for every role. It is a declared input of every role, so composing from *only* declared sources includes it; it travels with the input (piece 3), not in the system prompt. A wrong block misdirects every role at once, and the checkers receive the same block, so they share the error instead of catching it. Where the block is kept, and how a harness serving more than one repo picks the right one, are not fixed here.

A wrong block misdirects every role at once, and the checkers receive the same block, so they share the error instead of catching it. The block is kept in the repo it describes, at `.factory/context.md`. That directory, `.factory/`, is the repo's instance of the factory: `instance.yaml` (the per-repo config: `{repo name}`, protected paths, `{gate commands}`, models, routing, the store's path and the harness checkout it runs with), `context.md`, `harness.lock` (the harness revision the instance has accepted; the harness refuses to touch the instance's store under any other revision until a human accepts it, and logs the acceptance) and the store. The harness picks the instance by walking up from the working directory to the nearest `.factory/instance.yaml`, or takes it from an explicit override, and never falls back to an instance of its own; the composer prepends that instance's `context.md`, and the preamble's `{repo name}` and protected paths are filled from its `instance.yaml`.
 
 **Model per role, starting point.** One rule: a role's model depends on what checks its output. Default Opus. A checker is never weaker than the author it checks, except the verifier, whose check is the commands. Fable goes where a role's output is checked only by a human: the critic, the code reviewer, the retro. Sonnet only where the output is checked mechanically inside the same loop. The verifier is the one checker whose check is the commands themselves; its probe step is judgment, so it drops to Sonnet only where probes rarely matter. Tune effort before changing model; record the model on every run so the retro can compare failure rates by model; this table is the harness's model config, so a retro diff to it is the proposal path. Never let an author and its checker share a model where you can avoid it; the verifier is again the exception.
